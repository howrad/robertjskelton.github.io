I am a Cloud Architect/DevOps Engineer at [GE Transportation](https://www.getransportation.com) based in Palm Bay, FL. I earned a BS in Computer Engineering from Auburn University in May 2015, and I'll complete a MS in Computer Science from Georgia Tech in December 2019.  

My favorite topics are finance, technology, craft beer, cars, and home renovations, and this personal blog will have a little bit of each. I also run [Beer Tasting Brevard](https://beertastingbrevard.com).
