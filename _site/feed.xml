&lt;p&gt;My 2004 Honda S2000 has a sort of wide body kit at the back, but stock rims, so the tires and rims sit too far within the wheel well. There is a product called spacers, which is just a piece of aluminum that sits between your wheel hub and your rim, poking them slightly further out. I bought some 25mm spacers for my S2000 and installed them. This makes them stick out 25mm more on each side, so 50mm wider on the back tires overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before buying any spacers, I did a lot of research. There are lug centric spacers, and there are hub-centric spacers. Hub centric spacers have an additional lip that sits within your wheel, and they are much safer. H&amp;amp;R seems to have the best reputation within the S2000 community on spacers, so I bought &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3hbEJjK&quot;&gt;these H&amp;amp;R 25mm Aluminum spacers&lt;/a&gt; for about $150.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/spacers/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Spacers&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install, break the lug nuts on the back 2 tires. Jack up the rear of your S2000 and put it on some jack stands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/spacers/4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Spacers&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the back rims completely off. Find out you need new rear tires, like yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/spacers/5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Spacers&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the instructions to say to clean off any rust or grime off your hubs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used some light sandpaper, which didn’t do much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I sprayed some &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2YfqNMU&quot;&gt;PB Blaster&lt;/a&gt; on there, and that rust was gone! PB Blaster is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/spacers/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Spacers&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Place your spacer over the hub, and tighten on the new spacer nuts in a star pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/spacers/6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Spacers&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to use a 3/4” socket instead of my 3/4” lug nut tool, since the area around the spacer nuts was pretty small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tighten those in pretty good, put the rims back on, lower the car. Drive it for 50-100 miles, then take the wheels back off and re-tighten both spacers. They will loosen a little after your first time driving, so this is just to get them back into a permanent place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/spacers/8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Spacers&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/spacers/9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Spacers&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And done! The results are noticeable if you’re looking for them, wider in the back just like I wanted. The wheels look much more natural by not sitting so far within the wheel well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/spacers/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Spacers&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/spacers/before.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Spacers&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After and Before
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/spacers/both.png&quot; alt=&quot;Spacers&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been searching for a set of new rims and tires for my GX470 for a while, and finally bought a set of SR5 4Runner take off rims with decent tires for $350. My area isn’t a popular area for Toyotas, so not many rims for Toyotas come up for sale. I was searching for one of the following sets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SR5 4Runner takeoffs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4Runner Trail Teams&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;TRD Pros&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sequoia takeoffs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically anything that would fit my GX470, that wasn’t the rims it came with. Finally bought this set, and decided to paint them bronze. It’s popular now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, my prep was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pressure wash rims and center caps&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove Lexus logos from center caps&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/35Tl0jr&quot;&gt;320 grit sandpaper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3csHIBp&quot;&gt;400 grit sandpaper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wash the rims thoroughly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clean the tires with tire shine, so if you get any paint on them it will come off easy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Line the outside of the rims with 3”x5” notecards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A couple coats of &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/35ZfXhx&quot;&gt;Rust-Oleum Filler Primer&lt;/a&gt; with sanding after each coat. I used 4 cans on my 4 rims and center caps&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2H7U2dj&quot;&gt;Plasti-Dip&lt;/a&gt; the Lexus logos, did maybe 6 coats and used less than half a can.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 coats of &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2WTdaCi&quot;&gt;Dupli-Color Bronze Wheel Paint&lt;/a&gt;, I used all 6 cans of this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Super glue Lexus logos back to center caps&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A few coats of &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2YWROXi&quot;&gt;Dupli-Color Wheel Clearcoat&lt;/a&gt;. I used matte because it is all my local auto store had.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mount!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;here-are-the-progress-pictures&quot;&gt;Here are the progress pictures!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bought these rims, $350 with tires
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rims/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rims&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pressure washed
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rims/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rims&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rims/13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rims&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rims/14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rims&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently reorganized and cleaned out my garage so our cars have more space. Here are some of the things I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;new-cabinets&quot;&gt;New cabinets&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, old cabinets from the kitchen remodel. I painted them grey with spray paint, hung them up in a corner, and reused a small plastic organizer shelf for some additional storage. I actually hung these myself, using an old cabinet door as a bottom level and holder. Clamped the two cabinets together to screw them together, hung the doors using the old copper hardware, I think it looks good. I’ll add some copper handles eventually. This let me move a lot of things off my shelves in the corner, which I was able to reuse by moving a lot of stuff off the floor. Goal is to maximize floor space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/garage/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Garage&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/garage/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Garage&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/garage/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Garage&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/garage/4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Garage&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/garage/5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Garage&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/garage/11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Garage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;created-some-long-stuff-storage-hanging-in-the-air&quot;&gt;Created some long stuff storage hanging in the air&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made some hangers for wood/baseboards/trim/pipe/etc. Just used a long 2x4, cut into 6” sections and screwed into studs above the door and window. Gets some of that long stuff off the ground. Then I got rid of a ton of drywall and concrete backer board I don’t need.  Before and after!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/garage/6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Garage&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/garage/9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Garage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;created-pvc-organizers-for-yard-tools&quot;&gt;Created PVC organizers for yard tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was made from some PVC I was going to throw away. Cut the ends at 45 degrees so I could run a screw through to the stud. Put yard stuff in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/garage/7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Garage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, this took a few days of painting, cleaning, and abusing my Shop Vac. I need a new Ship Vac filter so bad now, but my garage is clean. Also I hung some posters and decorations up that were just sitting on the ground. More floor space!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/garage/8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Garage&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/garage/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Garage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Architecture of Money</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/Architecture-of-Money/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Architecture of Money" /><published>2020-04-24T11:20:14-04:00</published><updated>2020-04-24T11:20:14-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Architecture-of-Money</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Architecture-of-Money/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ccu/arch.png&quot; alt=&quot;Architecture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to talk about money, credit cards, banks, investing, etc. I realized that I knew where my money went, and it might be a little complicated, so I wanted to diagram it like a Cloud Architecture diagram. Here it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve got 2 paychecks coming in, one for my job, and one for my wife. Most of that money goes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/high-interest-checking-account/&quot;&gt;CCU&lt;/a&gt;, while some goes to Ally for our Emergency Fund, and some goes to Bethpage, where we have our HELOC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of our paychecks go towards investments before it hits the bank, like our 401K’s and HSA at Fidelity. Some goes to investments after it hits the bank, like our Roth IRAs and Brokerage, which are all at Vanguard. I also have accounts open at &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/robinhood/&quot;&gt;Robinhood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundrise.com/r/pdog4&quot;&gt;Fundrise&lt;/a&gt; that I don’t actively contribute to, just collect and reinvest dividends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of our auto-pays go out from CCU, including our mortgage, monthly credit card bills, and any utility bills that don’t let us pay by credit card. Our Bethpage account exists just for us to pay off our HELOC, which is also at Bethpage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s basically it. Money flows in and around, pays for stuff and gets invested. A little more complicated, but we’re seeing results!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Honda S2000 Exterior LED Swap</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/S2000-Exterior-LED-Swap/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Honda S2000 Exterior LED Swap" /><published>2020-01-15T10:20:14-05:00</published><updated>2020-01-15T10:20:14-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/S2000-Exterior-LED-Swap</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/S2000-Exterior-LED-Swap/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/s2k/11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;S2000 LEDs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did the interior LEDs a few months ago (which also included a few exterior lights), but now I needed to swap my brights and marker lights. Here are the parts I used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2qmq3sF&quot;&gt;High Beams: H1 x2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2S6HvcZ&quot;&gt;Accent Light on Front Headlights: 194 x2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to change these lights, you have to get your S2000 off the ground with the tires off, and pull off the inside liner. It is a huge pain to do this, here’s how to get the tires off and the car up in the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/s2k/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;S2000 LEDs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you’ll need some &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2QTtTnp&quot;&gt;ramps&lt;/a&gt;, some pieces of wood (I used old pieces of baseboards), and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.harborfreight.com/3-Ton-Low-Profile-Rapid-Pump-Floor-Jack-64264.html&quot;&gt;low profile jack&lt;/a&gt;. Put the wood in front of your ramps, then drive your car onto the wood and a little on to the ramp. Now you should be able to get the low profile jack under your car. I had to use some small wood blocks, or else the front bumper would have scraped my ramps. The jack is a low profile jack from Harbor Freight, but still is too high for the S2000 without being on some ramps. This car sits really low, even at stock height. Before you jack up your car, make sure you break the 19mm lug nuts on each wheel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/s2k/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;S2000 LEDs&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/s2k/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;S2000 LEDs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jack up the car so it’s in the air now. Put some jack stands under it and take 1 wheel off. Peel off the wheel well liner (again, mine didn’t have one when I bought it). The marker light is just a simple 194 LED swap. The high beam is a little more difficult. It is the light closest to your engine. Disconnect the wiring harness to it, then remove the rubber gasket keeping it watertight.
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/s2k/7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;S2000 LEDs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/s2k/5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;S2000 LEDs&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/s2k/8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;S2000 LEDs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can release the metal clamp thing (super annoying) and remove the old bulb.
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/s2k/9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;S2000 LEDs&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/s2k/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;S2000 LEDs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, place in the new bulb and try to work the clamp around it. Run the wiring out through the rubber gasket and place that gasket back on. Now plug in the red and black wires from the LED into the harness, and test your brights. If it doesn’t work, try reversing the polarity of your red and black wires, orientation matters! Once you’ve got it working, a little electrical tape would help, and run the wires back in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/s2k/4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;S2000 LEDs&quot; /&gt;
On the image above, the passenger high beam has been changed and the driver side bulb has not, for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can place that wheel back on and repeat for the other side. Remove the jack stands, lower the jack, drive your car back off your ramps and wood blocks, and you’ve got some great high beams! Some people get mad saying “putting LEDs in projector housing is bad and blinds people”, but these are high beams anyways, they shouldn’t be on while you’re driving behind or towards someone anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently sold my 2016 Corvette, and previously I had set up my car with the myChevrolet app on my Android phone. This app lets you lock and unlock your car, turn on the horn, and if your car is an automatic transmission (mine was a manual), you can remote start your car. Pretty sweet, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it turns out you never lose access to your car, even after you sell it. I sold my Vette on October 29, 2019. It has been over 90 days since I sold my car to Sarasota Ford, and then they sold the car to another customer. However, I still have access to unlock and lock my old car, turn on the horn, and more importantly see the location of the car!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mychevy/8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;App&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevy and OnStar partner to sell you location data in the app, which I never paid for. However there is a feature of the app that lets you track your driving habits, in order to get discounts on insurance. The app will tell you when and where your car performed hard braking, hard acceleration, when you drove at night, etc. It can send this info to Progressive or other insurance providers to prove you drive safe, and should get a discount. This was useful info when I used Turo to rent my Vette, before the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/My-Turo-Claim-Horror-Story&quot;&gt;Great Turo Fiasco of 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also view this data yourself, apparently even after you sell the car. So I can see where and when my old Corvette was driven, where the new buyer lives, where the new buyer works, what locations the new buyer visits, all of which are shown in a censored screenshot below. The uncensored version shows me the full address. I can unlock the car. If it was an automatic transmission, I could also start the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mychevy/9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;App&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;replication-steps&quot;&gt;Replication Steps&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the steps to replicate this in the myChevrolet app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Open the app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/mychevy/2.jpg&quot;&gt;App&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Click Smart Driver&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mychevy/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;App&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Click More Trip Detail Views.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mychevy/4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;App&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mychevy/6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;App&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mychevy/7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;App&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Click timeline to see exact address&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mychevy/9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;App&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also view other trips from the same day, or select other days to see location data and driving habits
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mychevy/5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;App&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a major security flaw. Chevrolet and GM need a process to verify that owners of cars linked to app still own their car regularly. I have reported this security issue to &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackerone.com/gm&quot;&gt;GM on HackerOne&lt;/a&gt;, there is no bug bounty for GM vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Kitchen Remodel</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/Kitchen-Remodel/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Kitchen Remodel" /><published>2019-12-10T11:00:14-05:00</published><updated>2019-12-10T11:00:14-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Kitchen-Remodel</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Kitchen-Remodel/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/kitchen/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kitchen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kitchen remodel. I’ve been dreading making this post because there is a lot of content, so here goes. We redid the 1980 kitchen in our house, and redid the layout, among other things. Everything. Here is all the tasks that the remodel consisted of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-1-demolition&quot;&gt;Part 1: Demolition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This step made so much dust, I changed the air filter in our house every day for a few weeks. The vacuums got a workout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove drop ceiling in Kitchen&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove built in pantry column in kitchen&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove all popcorn in house&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove cabinets in Kitchen&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove old tile floors in Kitchen&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dig trench in kitchen floor to run conduit and electrical to new island&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove old tile floors in hallway&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove old tile floors in guest bathroom&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove old tile floors in laundry room&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove speakers in ceiling in kitchen and bedrooms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-2-get-kitchen-ready-for-cabinets&quot;&gt;Part 2: Get kitchen ready for cabinets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This step took a really long time and progress was actually noticable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Re-route electrical that was in pantry column to other places&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Re-route air pipe, since this was in the drop ceiling before&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Replace any bad pieces of drywall&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Replace holes from where speakers and drop ceiling were&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Re-texture and paint ceiling in whole house&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Re-tile kitchen&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Re-tile hallway&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Re-tile guest bathroom&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Re-tile laundry room&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/kitchen/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kitchen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-3-kitchen-goes-in&quot;&gt;Part 3: Kitchen goes in!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally had a usable kitchen, this part took about 4 weeks to get to. Was very happy to not be using a microwave on my back patio anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add custom cabinets to Kitchen&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add electrical to island cabinet and back wall (between new pantry cabinets)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install old fridge and dishwasher&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install new microwave and range&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install counter top/sink&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect sink and disposal to water/drain&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install tile backsplash - I did this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-4-final-touch-up&quot;&gt;Part 4: Final touch up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install cabinet handles - I did this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cut and install shelf paper - Alex did this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Touch up paint basically every wall in the house - I did this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Re-install baseboards in kitchen - I did this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Caulk. So much caulk. - I did some of this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So those are the major steps. This took 6 weeks to complete the whole thing, and here is how the costs broke down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cabinets - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/waringbrotherscabinets/&quot;&gt;Waring Brothers Cabinets&lt;/a&gt; - $8550. Custom shaker white cabinets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Labor - Josh and Jen of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/atozcontemporarydesign/&quot;&gt;A to Z Contemporary Design&lt;/a&gt;- $9018. This number also included materials for the ceiling, like paint and texture. Josh and Jen and a few others did all the labor other than the few things noted.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Countertops/sink - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Surfside-Granite-Quartz-324158218503088/&quot;&gt;Surfside Granite&lt;/a&gt; - $4460. Cambria Brittanica Quartz&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Appliances - new GE slide in range and microwave (I had bought a dishwasher and fridge over the previous years as old appliances broke) - $1115. I bought these from a website called ABT that I found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/using-rakuten-for-more-cashback/&quot;&gt;Rakuten&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Permit - City of Palm Bay - $162&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flooring, grout, thin set - $950. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.homedepot.com/p/LifeProof-Blonde-Wood-6-in-x-24-in-Glazed-Porcelain-Floor-and-Wall-Tile-14-55-sq-ft-case-LP38624HD1PR/308527506&quot;&gt;6x24 LifeProof Blonde Wood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Backsplash, grout, thin set - $700. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.homedepot.com/p/Jeffrey-Court-Siberian-Gloss-11-625-in-x-11-75-in-x-8-mm-Glass-Mosaic-Tile-99520/202663565&quot;&gt;Siberian Glass Glass Tile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shelf Paper - $300&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cabinet Hardware - $100 - &lt;a href=&quot;https://brahmco.com/&quot;&gt;Brahmco&lt;/a&gt;. Super cheap hardware, I bought a decent amount of extras because so many of these broke on install.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Etc (oven cord, can light, transition piece, toilet seal) - $75&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;total--25430&quot;&gt;Total = $25,430&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/kitchen/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kitchen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal was to be at 20-22k for a kitchen remodel. This would probably be close, since these costs also include re-tiling ~400 sq ft of hallway, laundry room, and bathroom, and re-texturing all of the popcorn ceiling. Overall, I’m very happy with our new kitchen and other rooms, and was well worth $25k spent. Our old kitchen had cabinets falling apart, multiple broken tiles, and a terrible tile countertop that was impossible to keep clean. Our new quartz is SO easy to keep clean and makes cooking more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/G9fbve1XfvYaWzLD9&quot;&gt;Here is a link to an album&lt;/a&gt; of the full remodel process, over 200 pictures!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How to Drive Cool Cars on a Budget [Updated November 2019]</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/drive-cool-cars-on-a-budget-2019/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to Drive Cool Cars on a Budget [Updated November 2019]" /><published>2019-11-27T08:05:14-05:00</published><updated>2019-11-27T08:05:14-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/drive-cool-cars-on-a-budget-2019</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/drive-cool-cars-on-a-budget-2019/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cars/all.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Both&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of life’s biggest expenses is transportation, especially cars. I love cars, and love getting different cars. I get bored driving the same vehicle for more than a few years. You could imagine this would be expensive, but it doesn’t have to be. I’m 27 and have owned 12 cars, and I’ve not lost much money on them at all. The biggest downside is that you have to pay registration and taxes on every car you buy, but some of that can be tax deductible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list that follows is all of the cars I’ve owned, how much I paid and sold them for, how many miles I put on them, and about how expensive it was to own each one. I’ve included insurance costs, city/highway MPG, and the cost of oil changes and registration so that you can see how affordable each was to own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first 3 cars I owned in high school, so my parents helped me out by paying for gas, insurance, and registration. Also, 8 of these cars were Rear Wheel Drive, manual transmission cars, and I have owned two silver on black V8 automatic AWD SUVs. 6 of them were American made and had no issues, and 2 were German made and had so many issues. The two Japanese cars have been great so far, and the Italian Fiat we had was great for a long time, then got expensive to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-1993-ford-mustang-lx&quot;&gt;1. 1993 Ford Mustang LX&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bought: $1,700 / 195,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sold: $1,750 / 205,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MPG: 25/30, regular gas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Insurance: Unsure, parents paid for&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engine: 2.3L 4-cylinder, 100HP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oil Changes: $30 for standard oil change, every 3,000 to 5,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taxes/Registration: Unsure, parents paid for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cars/93mustang.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1993 Mustang&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This car was bought by my parents for me and my brother to learn to drive a manual transmission. I broke the clutch in it, and the A/C compressor went out in it, which cost about $600 to fix both. We owned it for a few years as an extra car, and sold it for more than we paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-1996-ford-mustang&quot;&gt;2. 1996 Ford Mustang&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bought: $3,600 / 118,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sold: $2,400 / 135,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MPG: 23/28, regular gas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Insurance: Unsure, parents paid for&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engine: 3.6L 6-cylinder, 150HP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oil Changes: $30 for standard oil change, every 3,000 to 5,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taxes/Registration: Unsure, parents paid for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cars/96mustang.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1996 Mustang&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the first car I bought myself, the older, silver Mustang in the middle of the picture. I put a $70 Cold Air Intake on it. Other than that, I did no major work on the car, so it had no expenses outside of gas and oil changes. I originally sold the car for $3,200, but the buyer blew a head gasket on the way home. This really surprised me, since after I had 17,000 issue-free miles, they broke a major part in a 5 mile drive home. Since they were family friends, I took it back, and sold it as is a week later for $800 less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-1999-chevrolet-camaro&quot;&gt;3. 1999 Chevrolet Camaro&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bought: $4,000 / 99,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sold: $3,600 / 115,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MPG: 22/27, regular gas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Insurance: Unsure, parents paid for&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engine: 3.8L 6-cylinder, 200HP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oil Changes: $30 for standard oil change, every 3,000 to 5,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taxes/Registration: Unsure, parents paid for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cars/camaro.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1999 Camaro&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought the Camaro before heading to college as something more exciting – it had T-Tops! The picture doesn’t portray how enthralled I was. I drove this at the beginning of my college career and had no issues with it. Just a couple hundred dollars upgrading the headlights and front grill, hey, I was 18! When I sold it after a few years, I didn’t lose much money to upgrade to my next car, which was a…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-2004-cadillac-cts-v&quot;&gt;4. 2004 Cadillac CTS-V&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bought: $17,800 / 49,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sold: $13,000 / 99,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MPG: 16/23, premium gas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Insurance: $120/mo for full coverage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engine: 5.7L 8-cylinder, 400HP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oil Changes: $100 for full synthetic oil change, every 10,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taxes/Registration: Unsure, parents paid for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cars/ctsv.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2004 CTS-V&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought this with the money I had saved from summer jobs and my first semester of Co-oping as a Test Engineer. It came with new tires, I got one set of new tires for free a few years later from my brother (he won them), and I sold it needing new tires. The CTS-V was an amazing car: a luxury sport sedan with a Corvette Z06 engine and a 6-speed manual transmission. I loved it! However, the insurance was really high, and so were the gas costs. This was the longest I had ever owned a car, which was about 4 years. I sold it when I moved down to Florida for my first real Engineering job. I still find myself wanting a car like this again, and they are still selling used years later for the same prices. No more depreciation on these, unfortunately for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-2008-chevrolet-corvette&quot;&gt;5. 2008 Chevrolet Corvette&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bought: $27,500 / 36,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sold: $26,500 /49,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MPG: 23/30, premium gas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Insurance: $90/mo for full coverage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engine: 6.2L 8-cylinder, 430HP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oil Changes: $100 for full synthetic oil change, every 10,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taxes/Registration: $3,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cars/c6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2008 Corvette&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought the Corvette after getting my first paycheck as a full time employee after college. A bright blue Corvette with a targa top in perfect Florida weather, why not? A few months later, I was wondering how bad of a financial decision it really was. My dad and brother gave me 0% loans since I couldn’t pay for all of it at once, and I was paying them about $1,000/month to pay it off quickly. It took about 6 months to pay off. Finally selling my CTS-V really helped. I owned the Corvette for a little over a year, and luckily sold it for not much of a loss in order to pay off the down payment on my house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying a Corvette and a house in the same year might not be the best financial decision, but it worked out for me once I sold the Vette. This was the nicest and fastest car I had owned at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expenses on this were really low, since insurance is super cheap and it got relatively good MPG for a sports car. Everyone wonders how the insurance low, so think about this: Who buys a Corvette, and what do they do with them? Most Corvette owners are 60+ and retired, and they use their Corvette as a weekend car or cruiser, not a daily driver. This means they are garaged the majority of the time, and there are not very many insurance claims on them. This drives the insurance price pretty low, which was great for me! Most people in Corvette Clubs like to brag how few miles they put on their Vette, I was the opposite. I put about 13,000 miles on mine in the year I owned it, and loved every single one of them. It made me want to get back into one once I was more financially stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-1999-porsche-boxster&quot;&gt;6. 1999 Porsche Boxster&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bought: $5,500 / 85,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sold: $5,000  / 89,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MPG: 19/25, premium gas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Insurance: $50/mo for legal minimum&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engine: 2.5L 6-cylinder, 200HP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oil Changes: $95 for full synthetic oil change, every 7,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taxes/Registration: $500&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cars/boxster.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1999 Boxster&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought the Porsche as a replacement to Corvette, which I sold to pay towards the down payment on my house. The difference in selling my Corvette and buying a Porsche was over $21,000! My co-workers wondered why I “upgraded” from a Corvette to a Porsche, and their jaw dropped when they find out I only paid $6,000 after tax and registration for it. The insurance for full coverage on it was about $130/mo, which I thought was insane on a car that’s so cheap. Therefore, I just went for the legal minimum. My thoughts were that if I wreck it, I can just buy another car. I’m also quite confident in my driving abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called it my cheap beater Porsche, and that’s not too far off. I converted the non-functional automatic convertible top to a manually-operated top, and I just leave it down all the time. The back window was plastic that has faded to yellow, so it had terrible visibility when the top is up. I spent $50 on new tail light bulbs and a new headlight switch, since those didn’t work when I bought it. Luckily for me, I picked this up for a steal on Craigslist, and bought it the same day it was posted. I loved driving a cheap car that I don’t care about anymore! I kept this about 9 months. I put about $350 into new brakes and rotors. I did them myself, since the dealer quoted $2,700 to do it. When I sold it on eBay, it needed a new water pump, which was about $700 installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lost about $1,000 to drive this for close to a year, not bad. I sold it to buy my first automatic car, and first non-sports car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought this awesome BMW SUV. It was $72,000 new, and I bought it for 10% of that. It was large inside, had a panoramic sunroof, Bluetooth, and heated seats in the front and back. Perfect for Florida! It came with huge 20″ rims that are 315 in the back. I got lots of compliments on the wheels. The car was enjoyable to drive, the A/C was so cold, and it felt like it owned the road. It’s not a sports car, but it’ll scoot. 360HP in this SUV is no slouch. It’s got torque to tow as well. The gas mileage is horrific on this car, and it holds 25 gallons of premium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never bought new tires on it or did oil changes since I didn’t own it for long, but it had a TON of problems. The inside driver door panel was off for at least half the time I owned it, and I replaced almost every part in there myself. The window barely worked. I ended up using a zip tie to solder a piece of plastic together inside the door. The BMW and Porsche I had might have been lemons, It needed a water pump and coolant flush before I tried selling it private party, then ended up trading it in on this…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/turo/vette.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Corvette&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newest car and by far the most expensive car I’ve ever owned. Something about lifestyle creep… I got a 1.49% interest rate 48 month car loan on a USED car. Found this 1-owner, higher mileage C7 Corvette at a dealer. It was the exact combo I wanted, blue exterior and brown/tan interior, 2LT, manual transmission. It was Certified Pre-Owned, so it has free oil changes and services for a few years, plus it was a better price than any 2016 for sale in the country at the time. I haggled for a while, got up to leave a few times, and got about 3k off the dealer price and got more than I paid for my BMW on trade in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2016 came with a front camera so you don’t hit the front bumper parking, and a flat bottom steering wheel. This is such a nice car, and I’m making some money on the side &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/rent-other-peoples-cars-with-turo/&quot;&gt;renting it with Turo&lt;/a&gt;. I was really tired of how expensive the BMW was and how unreliable it was, so I was happy to pay a premium to get into a reliable American car again. Plus it has cylinder deactivation to run on 4-cylinders when you want to, which helped me get 36 MPG on a road trip to Tampa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my Vette was CPO, I never paid for oil changes on it. I owned it for almost 2 years before trading it in for a nicer car for my wife. I lost more on this car than any car I’ve ever had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cars/lexus.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;GX470&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We needed something larger than a Corvette or Fiat to move our dogs around and do more home improvement projects, so I wanted to get something reliable SUV that would last a very long time. I did my research and decided on a Toyota 4Runner, with leather and a V8. So the 4th generation (2003-2009) Toyota 4Runner V8 Limited. Unfortunately, those are rare, and relatively expensive. Then I found out that Lexus made the same car, with more factory options and it’s even nicer than the 4Runner, has a V8, leather, and it sells for less than a V8 Limited 4Runner. That sold me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was originally planning to buy a 2003 model in Pennsylvania for $5,000, but it had rust, was a little rough, and the owner was seeming like he was never going to deliver it. I was paying him to drive it down, but he flaked on me 3 separate times. I had searches set up on every website you can think of, and not many come up for sale. One ended up showing up in Melbourne, FL, where I live, for 10k. It was more than I was wanting to spend, but it was much lower miles, newer, and nicer than I was planning on buying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was this one that I bought. I was going to go look at it, so I scheduled and appointment with this local car dealer for the next day. They called me that day and said the car had already sold, pending financing. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They called me back another day later and said financing fell through, so I went down that day and bought it, putting almost $7k of the purchase on a Capital One Venture card to get a signing bonus! This car was nearly perfect, super low miles for the model, recent maintenance on the timing belt and water pump, new battery, tires, brakes - it needs nothing. I got this car for below market (the car would’ve sold the next day if I didn’t buy it), and I plan on driving it until it dies. This is a car that needs very little maintenance since it’s a Toyota, it’ll run 3,4,500k miles, and I’m already loving it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you check the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/category/cars/&quot;&gt;cars category&lt;/a&gt; of my website, I detail many of the mods I’ve been doing on my GX, I really love this car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife’s parents bought her this car in college. It was a decent little car for a while, it went almost 70,000 miles with not many issues. The last 10k miles we owned it, it went through 4 window regulators and the car died on her at work one day, ended up being a bushing in the shifter that prevented the car from starting. We decided it was time to upgrade her, and we bought her a…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sweet convertible Mustang! It has white paint with a rare red interior, there were only 3 for sale in America with that combo when we bought this. This car is fast for a 4 cylinder, and is just as nice as my Corvette was. It’s the Premium Plus package, so it has lots of digital displays, heated and cooled seats, CarPlay and Android Auto and tons of other great features. This is a super comfortable car that is also fun to drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We bought this CPO from Sarasota Ford over in Sarasota, FL. We drove both the Fiat and Corvette over and traded them both in. It was really sad to see my C7 go, but at the same time, it was way too expensive of a car for me. I got a little upset not having a fun manual sports car though, so I bought myself a…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great deal on an AP2 S2000, with very low miles. So now we have the Lexus, Mustang, and my S2000. This car doesn’t get driven with the top up, only down. It’s a fun little sports car to drive around town in, but not comfortable at all. It has some aftermarket bumpers and side skirts, and a paint job, and I had all of those things. It was sports car red from the factory, and the previous owner painted it maroon. Maybe eventually I’ll convert it back to stock and get the nice red paint back on it, but for now I just use this to run errands around town, as long as I don’t have to carry too much stuff. This drives just like my old Boxster, which is great, but it’s a Honda, so it is reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
