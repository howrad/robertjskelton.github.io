      <div class="entry">
        <p>I started using <a href="https://www.ebates.com/r/ROBERT47769?eeid=28187">Ebates</a> in February 2017, when I really started putting lots of money into <a href="https://rskelton.com/category/renovations">renovating</a> my house. <a href="https://www.ebates.com/r/ROBERT47769?eeid=28187">Ebates</a> is a website and browser extension (I have it installed as a Chrome extension). When you go to a website, it’ll pop up if you can buy things and get cash back. You simply click “Activate X% Cash Back”, and you earn money in your <a href="https://www.ebates.com/r/ROBERT47769?eeid=28187">Ebates</a> account. The amount of cash back per store varies. After you earn $25, they direct deposit your money to your Paypal, or send you a “Big Fat Check”.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>I replaced 2 drains on my master vanity with <a href="https://amzn.to/2x1YWCt">pop up drains</a>. The vanity I installed does not have the lever to pull up and down the stopper in the drain, so this style is a functional way to have working stoppers. Previously, I had normal drains, and I could not put the stopper down. They were attempted to be pushed down by a few guests, and eventually broke, so I decided to finally replace them!</p>

        <p>A cool metric to track your net worth is against your lifetime earnings, of which you can pull from your social security income. I first heard of this from <a href="https://retireby40.org/your-lifetime-wealth-ratio/">Retire By 40</a>, which he calls your Lifetime Wealth Ratio. Basically, it’s a way to how well you are investing, or if you’re overspending. I decided to run mine and see!</p>

        <p>My fiancé, Elizabeth, and I adopted a black lab mix puppy from the <a href="https://www.leecountyhumane.org/">Lee County Humane Society</a> in Auburn, AL in April 2017. His name is Bentley, and he’s a wonderful dog! He weighs about 65 pounds, and stays with me while I work from home. I wanted to know exactly how much he was costing us, so here’s the expenses for our dog broken down. This post is also an excuse to publish tons of dog pictures.</p>

        <p>My fiancé has a 2013 Fiat 500, which has been a great little car. Great gas mileage, easy to drive, hardly any issues in almost 60,000 miles! The window regulator broke on the passenger side, which was fixed at the dealer for $300, just out of warranty. The steering wheel column cover also broke, and the dealer wanted $600 to fix that, so I decided to see what I could do.</p>

        <p>I had a pool enclosure on my house, it was likely built along with the pool in the 80s or 90s. These enclosures are common to have over Florida pools to keep leaves and bugs out. Some people call them screen, cages, bird cages, enclosures, etc. I had a few screen panels blown out in 2016 during Hurricane Matthew, and the guy who replaced them said I’d be lucky if my enclosure lasted 5 more years. It lasted 1.</p>

        <p>I completed a quick bathroom remodel the weekend on the guest bathroom with the help of my fiancés mom, (Cindy) and one of my roommates (Alex). I kept the existing vanity and shower, but gave everything a nice touchup. The changes included new paint on the walls and vanity cabinets, new towel and toilet paper holders, new mirror, new vanity light, new baseboards, and a new curved shower rod curtain. Both the shower rod curtain and vanity light are the same model as in the master bathroom we remodeled recently. I kept the existing over the toilet wall mounted storage, since it’s in good shape. Here are the before pictures:</p>

        <p>My 2016 Corvette came with the stock, chrome grill when I bought it. Some Corvette owners make fun of it, saying it looks like braces or orthodontics. I kinda agree, it doesn’t look great. I could’ve bought the Z06 grill insert, which is about $200 and looks better, or a homemade method to remove the chrome – electrical tape.</p>

        <p>Most people keep a bank account to pay their bills, mortgage, credit cards, loan, etc. My checking account is used to pay my mortgage, credit cards, and other bills on auto-pay, and distribute money into various investments. Most people utilize a basic checking account which earns little to no interest. In fact, most big name national banks only give .01% interest! I use a little known credit union in Illinois, even though I live in Florida and have never visited the bank in person.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>I buy stocks for no commissions using <a href="http://share.robinhood.com/roberts459">Robinhood</a>. <a href="http://sshare.robinhood.com/roberts459">Robinhood</a> has an iOS and Android app, and recently unveiled a web interface. Unfortunately, <a href="http://share.robinhood.com/roberts459">Robinhood</a> does not link with <a href="https://rskelton.com/personal-capital-review">Personal Capital</a>, but you can add your shares manually. They’ve lowered the barrier to entry when buying individual securities. It used to be that you’d pay $7+ per trade, so you’d only buy $1,000 or more of stocks at a time. Now, you can buy stocks with no fees!</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>One of life’s biggest expenses is transportation, especially cars. I love cars, and love getting different cars. I get bored driving the same vehicle for more than a few years. You could imagine this would be expensive, but it doesn’t have to be. I’m 26 and have owned 8 cars, and I’ve not lost much money on them at all. The biggest downside is that you have to pay registration and taxes on every car you buy, but some of that can be tax deductible.</p>
