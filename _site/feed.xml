I kept the existing vanity and shower, but gave everything a nice touchup. The changes included new paint on the walls and vanity cabinets, new towel and toilet paper holders, new mirror, new vanity light, new baseboards, and a new curved shower rod curtain. Both the shower rod curtain and vanity light are the same model as in the master bathroom we remodeled recently. I kept the existing over the toilet wall mounted storage, since it’s in good shape. Here are the before pictures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/before1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/before2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/before3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/before4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vanity top was pretty nice, but the cabinets were yellow (WHY) and the hardware was bad. I took the vanity doors and hardware off, and painted everything with 2 coats of primer (Kilz) and 2 coats of a white finish coat (Behr). I bought new hinges and handles to finish it off, along with lots of caulk and wood fill to mask the previous imperfections in the cabinets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/cabinets1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cabinets&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/cabinets2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cabinets&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/cabinets3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cabinets&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/cabinets4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cabinets&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before painting, I took off the old school toothbrush holder, toilet paper holder and towel holder. They were plastered in, so I did as good a job as I can with re-drywalling and patching. We bought 1 gallon of a green paint, and didn’t even use half of it.  Cindy was a huge help with the painting. Notice the blue outlines on the mirror - that’s the size of the new medicine cabinet mirror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/process1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Process&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/process2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Process&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/process3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Process&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/process4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Process&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were also 2 hooks on the ceiling, maybe for hanging plants? They were above the old vanity light. I took the hooks down and plastered and painted over them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/process5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Process&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/process6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Process&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/process7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Process&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we painted before installing the new vanity light, it was dark in the bathroom. There are no windows! We used a work lamp to paint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/process8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Process&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/process9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Process&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/process10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Process&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/process11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Process&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/process12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Process&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/process13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Process&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/process14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Process&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bathroom doesn’t have pull out drawers in the vanity, they’re blanks, so there isn’t much storage. I decided to buy the biggest medicine cabinet I could find, which was 48” x 30”. It’s almost as big as the old mirror was. This gives more storage and a more modern look. A new vanity light helped as well. I installed a dual curved shower curtain holder, so you can hang towels on the outside and people can still shower. The toilet paper holder has a storage spot on top for baby wipes. Alex was helpful in installing all the new wall hanging hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/shower.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Done&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old shower tile doesn’t match great with the new bathroom, but it’ll get retiled…eventually… This is nice for now. There’s enough storage for my roommates to keep their stuff off of the vanity so that guests can have a nicer bathroom, and the room seems so much bigger now that it’s actually nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/final1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Done&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/final2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Done&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/final3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Done&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the costs, I bought most of the smaller items off Amazon, the Mirrored Medicine Cabinet was bought in person from Home Depot, and the Vanity Light was bought online from Lowe’s with a coupon. I already had the primer and white paint, tools, paintbrushes, drywall, etc. Here’s the breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;final-expenses&quot;&gt;Final Expenses:&lt;/h1&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Paint $38&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Caulk $6&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cabinet Hardware $50&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2Fv57Rp&quot;&gt;Towel Bar&lt;/a&gt; $19&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2JDW7fk&quot;&gt;Hand Towel Holder&lt;/a&gt; $17&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2JAuqEf&quot;&gt;Toilet Paper Holder&lt;/a&gt; $12&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2Fu8055&quot;&gt;Double Shower Curtain Rod&lt;/a&gt; $35&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;total-428&quot;&gt;Total: $428!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was under $500, sweet! As a bonus, here’s a picture of a 48” x 30” mirrored medicine cabinet in the back of the Corvette. The guy at Home Depot who helped me load it in was skeptical, but this car is as practical as any truck.&lt;/p&gt;

Some Corvette owners make fun of it, saying it looks like braces or orthodontics. I kinda agree, it doesn’t look great. I could’ve bought the Z06 grill insert, which is about $200 and looks better, or a homemade method to remove the chrome – electrical tape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/braces/before.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice there is a single chrome strip through the middle of the grill, with a small split in the middle. I took some simple black electrical tape and stretched it to cover one half, then pressed firmly to let it adhere. I used an X-Acto knife to cut around the thinner part near the middle, shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/braces/xacto.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;X-Acto Knifing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then repeat for the other half, and put a small section of electrical tape over the center gap, so that you can’t see any chrome. See the results below! I think it’s a huge improvement, and I can always switch back to chrome if I change my mind!&lt;/p&gt;

Most people utilize a basic checking account which earns little to no interest. In fact, most big name national banks only give .01% interest! I use a little known credit union in Illinois, even though I live in Florida and have never visited the bank in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The credit union is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.myconsumers.org/personal/checking&quot;&gt;Consumers Credit Union (CCU)&lt;/a&gt;. They have a high interest checking account that gives 3.09% interest on up to $10,000 and no ATM fees. There are a few hoops you have to jump through to get that high interest rate, which are easy to manage and VERY worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get one direct deposit per month. Easy, just setup some or all of your workplace paycheck to use this bank. The majority of my paycheck goes here every other week.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Access online banking once per month. This is easily accomplished using finance aggregation websites, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/personal-capital-review&quot;&gt;Personal Capital&lt;/a&gt; or Mint. I prefer &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/personal-capital-review&quot;&gt;Personal Capital&lt;/a&gt; for wealth management, but I think Mint is better for budgeting. I used Mint throughout college to get a better grasp on finances, though I made the switch to &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/personal-capital-review&quot;&gt;Personal Capital&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 when I discovered Mint couldn’t track my mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You also need to elect to receive eDocuments. Sure, easy, no one wants more snail mail.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, complete 12 pin-less debit transactions. This is the only one that requires effort. For this, both my brother and I have our CCU debit card linked to Facebook Messenger. Every month, we send each other 12 individual one cent transactions. Each one registers as a pin-less debit card transactions, and our obligations are met!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This yields me about $30-50 per month just off of my money I have in a holding pattern, waiting to pay off my utility bills, credit cards, and mortgage. There are a few small tasks you have to setup to take advantage of the higher interest rates, but are well worth checking out. If you don’t meet all of the above, you still earn .01%, which is normal for big banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ccu/interest.png&quot; alt=&quot;Interest&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;higher-interest-accounts&quot;&gt;Higher Interest Accounts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They even have a few tiers of higher interest checking accounts available, but those require you to use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.myconsumers.org/credit-cards/visa-cards/visa-signature-cash-rebate-card&quot;&gt;CCU Visa Signature Cash credit card&lt;/a&gt;. If you get their credit card and spend $500/mo on it, you earn 4.09% interest on up to a 15k balance. If you spend $1,000/mo on their credit card, you earn 4.59% interest on up to a 20k balance. I’ve been using the credit card for a few months, and usually spend a little over $1,000 on it to get the best interest rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ccu/rewards.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rewards&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;credit-card&quot;&gt;Credit Card&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CCU credit card also offers 3% back on grocery stores, 2% on gas, and 1% on everything else. My favorite thing about this credit card is that all rewards accumulated over the month are automatically applied to your statement. Unlike Discover, Chase, Amex, etc, you don’t have to manually login to redeem rewards in $25 increments! It requires a hard pull on your credit, but has been very worth it for me so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;loans&quot;&gt;Loans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also use a car loan through Consumers Credit Union, which I talked more about in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/rent-other-peoples-cars-with-turo/&quot;&gt;Turo Review.&lt;/a&gt; I took a ~$37,000 used car loan for 48 months at 1.49% interest, which is REALLY low for a used car. These payments come out every 2 weeks from my checking account. Notice you can also check your CCU credit card statements from the loan section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ccu/loans.png&quot; alt=&quot;Loans&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;downsides&quot;&gt;Downsides&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found a few downsides for using Consumers Credit Union. Checks cost money, which I think is normal now, and also I can’t deposit cash. The CCU app lets your deposit checks using pictures, like most major banks, but there is no way to deposit cash when you live in Florida and all the physical locations are in Illinois. I have a local credit union that I deposit my cash into, but I don’t keep much money there since the interest rate is only .01%. If you don’t want to jump through a few hoops, you can earn over 1.5% at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ally.com&quot;&gt;Ally Bank&lt;/a&gt;, which I recommend as a good place for your emergency fund!&lt;/p&gt;

I’m over-invested in one place right now, and it’s my own employer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;current&quot;&gt;Current&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started working at General Electric (GE) a little over a year ago. I wanted to have stock in my company, so I started buying GE shares on &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/robinhood&quot;&gt;Robinhood&lt;/a&gt;. As you might have seen, GE stock is doing terribly, and I’ve lost over $1,000 on my shares so far. My first share was bought for $32. Shares dropped into the $12 range recently. I also put a 5% of my 401k contributions into a GE stock fund. That small portion of my contribution is down over 30%! And to make my reliance on the General even worse, GE pays my paycheck. GE is not doing so hot right now, with occasional layoffs, selling businesses, cost cutting methods, reduced travel, etc. My division,  GE Transportation, is for sale, though we’re doing pretty well. I got my first bonus this year, and a better raise than I ever got at previous employers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;looking-ahead&quot;&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though my division is in talks of being sold, I will likely retain my job since I’m good at it, it saves the company a ton of money, and do it for a low price compared to others with the same skills. However, in the next few years, my paycheck will likely not come from GE. Instead, it will come from whatever company purchases the Transportation division. I think that GE stock will be a great long term investment. I won’t sell my shares for many, many years, and they will continue to pay dividends, even though there was a recent major dividend slash. GE stock is at a great price right now, and I’m happy to be buying more shares and accumulating them in my 401k as well. The upside is a few years out, but I’ll be patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, just a small word of advice on not to get too invested in the success of your employer! Do as I say, not as I do.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This is just a friendly word of caution about putting all of your eggs in one basket.

Unfortunately, &lt;a href=&quot;http://share.robinhood.com/roberts459&quot;&gt;Robinhood&lt;/a&gt; does not link with &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/personal-capital-review&quot;&gt;Personal Capital&lt;/a&gt;, but you can add your shares manually. They’ve lowered the barrier to entry when buying individual securities. It used to be that you’d pay $7+ per trade, so you’d only buy $1,000 or more of stocks at a time. Now, you can buy stocks with no fees!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/robinhood/pc.png&quot; alt=&quot;Robinhood on Personal Capital&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got over $3,600 in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://share.robinhood.com/roberts459&quot;&gt;Robinhood&lt;/a&gt; account, and until recently was putting more money in every week. Now, I just re-invest my dividends and put more towards my taxable brokerage account in Vanguard. Most of my shares are in Orchid Island Capital (ORC) and General Electric (GE). ORC is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) which gives monthly dividends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/robinhood/dividends.png&quot; alt=&quot;My Recent Dividends&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both ORC and GE have done pretty terrible since I’ve bought them, and both have cut their dividends pretty significantly. I’ve lost a large chunk of money on GE, which is in its worst period ever. I work at GE, and I don’t think it’ll be this cheap forever, so I’m banking on a large return at some point in my lifetime - I’m in no hurry to sell. My main goal is to receive dividends from all my my stocks. I earn about $300/yr in dividends right now, and that’s only going up. At some point, dividends will be a larger part of my total income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/robinhood/ios.png&quot; alt=&quot;Robinhood iOS Application&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to try it out, use my &lt;a href=&quot;http://share.robinhood.com/roberts459&quot;&gt;referral code&lt;/a&gt;. If you do, you’ll get a free stock, and I’ll get a free share when you buy your first stock. These shares can be worth from $3 to $150. My girlfriend signed up and got a share of HP (HPQ) worth about $19 at the time. Most of the free shares I’ve earned have been worth about $6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re trading on &lt;a href=&quot;http://share.robinhood.com/roberts459&quot;&gt;Robinhood&lt;/a&gt;, I highly recommend doing a limit buy or limit sell. This way you specify the most you’d pay for a stock, or the least you’d sell your stock for. Some people put in many limit buys for low prices, and many limit sells for high prices. That way, if a stock happens to get pretty high, it’ll automatically sell. This could be awesome if you’re just trying to flip stocks, but it might go up even higher than your limit sell is set at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://share.robinhood.com/roberts459&quot;&gt;Robinhood&lt;/a&gt; has recently added cryptocurrencies and options to their repertoire of services, though I haven’t delved into either. You can buy and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, along with tons of other crypto, and also buy and sell options of stocks. I don’t quite understand options, other than that you can make or lose a lot of money very quickly. I’ll stick with the tried and true dividend stocks. I have a little bit of crypto, but I bought it before Robinhood released that feature.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I buy stocks for no commissions using Robinhood.

Now, you can buy stocks with no fees!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">rskelton.com Tech Stack Details</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/rskelton-tech-stack/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="rskelton.com Tech Stack Details" /><published>2018-04-11T14:05:14-04:00</published><updated>2018-04-11T14:05:14-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/rskelton-tech-stack</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/rskelton-tech-stack/">&lt;p&gt;This blog, hosted at &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com&quot;&gt;rskelton.com&lt;/a&gt;, is one of the many iterations of Robert Skelton’s personal blog. Over the years, it has been hosted at &lt;a href=&quot;https://robertjskelton.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;robertjskelton.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;, robertjskelton.com (dead), and skelton.co (dead). I have hosted it using WordPress on DigitalOcean, Github Pages, a Static AWS S3 bucket, and now this current iteration is my favorite. This site is here to stay, finally. This site also merges content from citrusrenovations.com (defunct home renovation blog) and retirengineering.com (defunct financial blog), both of which I hosted using WordPress on DigitalOcean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I previously set up rskelton.com using a Highly Available (HA) WordPress install on AWS. I use AWS for my job full time, so this was good experience. The problem is, it’s really expensive to have a HA install, $70/mo or more. I didn’t want to pay that much for just a blog, so I set about finding a new way to manage a blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;rskelton.com currently uses the following technologies, and drew inspiration from &lt;a href=&quot;https://hendrixjoseph.github.io&quot;&gt;Joe Hendrix’s Github Page&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, specifically &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jekyllnow.com/&quot;&gt;jekyll-now&lt;/a&gt;. Jekyll is an awesome framework that turns markdown into a website. It takes a little while to get used to it, definitely more complicated than Wordpress, but worth the time to learn it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;Github pages&lt;/a&gt;, which automatically runs and hosts the jekyll markdown code&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Github is where for the code for the site is hosted. It is all open source in my public repo, available &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/robertjskelton/robertjskelton.github.io&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. For new posts, I create a post locally on my laptop. I can use “jekyll serve” to preview changes in a browser at “localhost:4000”, and then push my changes to my repo. After that, they appear on &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com&quot;&gt;rskelton.com&lt;/a&gt; within seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/route53/&quot;&gt;Route 53&lt;/a&gt; in AWS, this is my DNS. I pay a small amount per lookup, less than $1/month.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com&quot;&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt; for SSL. Github pages does SSL if you use their website name (robertjskelton.github.io) but since I used a custom domain, that isn’t supported. Cloudflare provides a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/&quot;&gt;simple way&lt;/a&gt; to fix that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://disqus.com/&quot;&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt; for comments.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://analytics.google.com&quot;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt; for Analytics.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/adsense&quot;&gt;Google Adsense&lt;/a&gt; for ads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also own the following websites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://beertastingbrevard.com&quot;&gt;Beer Tasting Brevard&lt;/a&gt; - a beer tasting company website that I started. It is hosted using a static S3 bucket, AWS Cloudfront for SSL, and Route 53 for DNS. I also have some Javascript on the site that uses Instagram API to pull new images from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/beertastingbrevard&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;. This way, I never have to manually update pictures on the website, new images are automatically populated from Instagram posts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://robertsvalvejrmods.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;Robert’s Epiphone Valve Jr Mods&lt;/a&gt; - Hosted with Blogspot, this was an Electrical Engineering undergrad project, I made a bunch of modifications to a guitar amp and documented them on this site.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://robertandashleightakeeurope.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;Europe Travel Blog&lt;/a&gt; - Hosted with Blogspot, this is a 2013 Europe travel blog. If I hadn’t made these 2 blogs using Blogspot, I’m 100% sure I would have tried to change hosts 10 times and lost all my content over the last 5 years. Blogspot isn’t fancy or pretty, but I’m glad I used it back then.&lt;/li&gt;

I love cars, and love getting different cars. I get bored driving the same vehicle for more than a few years. You could imagine this would be expensive, but it doesn’t have to be. I’m 26 and have owned 8 cars, and I’ve not lost much money on them at all. The biggest downside is that you have to pay registration and taxes on every car you buy, but some of that can be tax deductible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list that follows is all of the cars I’ve owned, how much I paid and sold them for, how many miles I put on them, and about how expensive it was to own each one. I’ve included insurance costs, city/highway MPG, and the cost of oil changes and registration so that you can see how affordable each was to own. My first 3 cars I owned in high school, so my helped me out by paying for gas, insurance, and registration. Also, 7 of these cars were Rear Wheel Drive, manual transmission cars, and I have owned a single automatic, AWD SUV. 6 of the 8 were American made and had no isses, and 2 were German made and had so many issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-1993-ford-mustang-lx&quot;&gt;1. 1993 Ford Mustang LX&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bought: $1,700 / 195,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sold: $1,750 / 205,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MPG: 25/30, regular gas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Insurance: Unsure, parents paid for&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engine: 2.3L 4-cylinder, 100HP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oil Changes: $30 for standard oil change, every 3,000 to 5,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taxes/Registration: Unsure, parents paid for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cars/93mustang.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1993 Mustang&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This car was bought by my parents for me and my brother to learn to drive a manual transmission. I broke the clutch in it, and the A/C compressor went out in it, which cost about $600 to fix both. We owned it for a few years as an extra car, and sold it for more than we paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-1996-ford-mustang&quot;&gt;2. 1996 Ford Mustang&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bought: $3,600 / 118,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sold: $2,400 / 135,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MPG: 23/28, regular gas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Insurance: Unsure, parents paid for&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engine: 3.6L 6-cylinder, 150HP&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cars/96mustang.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1996 Mustang&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the first car I bought myself, the older, silver Mustang in the middle of the picture. I put a $70 Cold Air Intake on it. Other than that, I did no major work on the car, so it had no expenses outside of gas and oil changes. I originally sold the car for $3,200, but the buyer blew a head gasket on the way home. This really surprised me, since after I had 17,000 issue-free miles, they broke a major part in a 5 mile drive home. Since they were family friends, I took it back, and sold it as is a week later for $800 less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-1999-chevrolet-camaro&quot;&gt;3. 1999 Chevrolet Camaro&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Sold: $3,600 / 115,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MPG: 22/27, regular gas&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cars/camaro.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1999 Camaro&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought the Camaro before heading to college as something more exciting – it had T-Tops! The picture doesn’t portray how enthralled I was. I drove this at the beginning of my college career and had no issues with it. Just a couple hundred dollars upgrading the headlights and front grill, hey, I was 18! When I sold it after a few years, I didn’t lose much money to upgrade to my next car, which was a…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-2004-cadillac-cts-v&quot;&gt;4. 2004 Cadillac CTS-V&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bought: $17,800 / 49,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sold: $13,000 / 99,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MPG: 16/23, premium gas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Insurance: $120/mo for full coverage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engine: 5.7L 8-cylinder, 400HP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oil Changes: $100 for full synthetic oil change, every 10,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taxes/Registration: Unsure, parents paid for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cars/ctsv.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2004 CTS-V&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought this with the money I had saved from summer jobs and my first semester of Co-oping as a Test Engineer. It came with new tires, I got one set of new tires for free a few years later from my brother (he won them), and I sold it needing new tires. The CTS-V was an amazing car: a luxury sport sedan with a Corvette Z06 engine and a 6-speed manual transmission. I loved it! However, the insurance was really high, and so were the gas costs. This was the longest I had ever owned a car, which was about 4 years. I sold it when I moved down to Florida for my first real Engineering job. I still find myself wanting a car like this again, and they are still selling used years later for the same prices. No more depreciation on these, unfortunately for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-2008-chevrolet-corvette&quot;&gt;5. 2008 Chevrolet Corvette&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bought: $27,500 / 36,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sold: $26,500 /49,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MPG: 23/30, premium gas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Insurance: $90/mo for full coverage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engine: 6.2L 8-cylinder, 430HP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oil Changes: $100 for full synthetic oil change, every 10,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taxes/Registration: $3,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cars/c6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2008 Corvette&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought the Corvette after getting my first paycheck as a full time employee after college. A bright blue Corvette with a targa top in perfect Florida weather, why not? A few months later, I was wondering how bad of a financial decision it really was. My dad and brother gave me 0% loans since I couldn’t pay for all of it at once, and I was paying them about $1,000/month to pay it off quickly. It took about 6 months to pay off. Finally selling my CTS-V really helped. I owned the Corvette for a little over a year, and luckily sold it for not much of a loss in order to pay off the down payment on my house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying a Corvette and a house in the same year might not be the best financial decision, but it worked out for me once I sold the Vette. This was the nicest and fastest car I had owned at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expenses on this were really low, since insurance is super cheap and it got relatively good MPG for a sports car. Everyone wonders how the insurance low, so think about this: Who buys a Corvette, and what do they do with them? Most Corvette owners are 60+ and retired, and they use their Corvette as a weekend car or cruiser, not a daily driver. This means they are garaged the majority of the time, and there are not very many insurance claims on them. This drives the insurance price pretty low, which was great for me! Most people in Corvette Clubs like to brag how few miles they put on their Vette, I was the opposite. I put about 13,000 miles on mine in the year I owned it, and loved every single one of them. It made me want to get back into one once I was more financially stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-1999-porsche-boxster&quot;&gt;6. 1999 Porsche Boxster&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bought: $5,500 / 85,000 miles
Sold: $5,000  / 89,000 miles
MPG: 19/25, premium gas
Insurance: $50/mo for legal minimum
Engine: 2.5L 6-cylinder, 200HP
Oil Changes: $95 for full synthetic oil change, every 7,000 miles
Taxes/Registration: $500&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cars/boxster.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1999 Boxster&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought the Porsche as a replacement to Corvette, which I sold to pay towards the down payment on my house. The difference in selling my Corvette and buying a Porsche was over $21,000! My co-workers wondered why I “upgraded” from a Corvette to a Porsche, and their jaw dropped when they find out I only paid $6,000 after tax and registration for it. The insurance for full coverage on it was about $130/mo, which I thought was insane on a car that’s so cheap. Therefore, I just went for the legal minimum. My thoughts were that if I wreck it, I can just buy another car. I’m also quite confident in my driving abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called it my cheap beater Porsche, and that’s not too far off. I converted the non-functional automatic convertible top to a manually-operated top, and I just leave it down all the time. The back window was plastic that has faded to yellow, so it had terrible visibility when the top is up. I spent $50 on new tail light bulbs and a new headlight switch, since those didn’t work when I bought it. Luckily for me, I picked this up for a steal on Craigslist, and bought it the same day it was posted. I loved driving a cheap car that I don’t care about anymore! I kept this about 9 months. I put about $350 into new brakes and rotors. I did them myself, since the dealer quoted $2,700 to do it. When I sold it on eBay, it needed a new water pump, which was about $700 installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lost about $1,000 to drive this for close to a year, not bad. I sold it to buy my first automatic car, and first non-sports car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-2005-bmw-x5-48&quot;&gt;7. 2005 BMW X5 4.8&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Bought: $7,000 / 102,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sold: $7,005 in trade-in / 108,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MPG: 14/19, premium gas (ouch)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Insurance: $67/mo for legal minimum&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engine: 4.8L 8-cylinder, 360HP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oil Changes: None yet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taxes/Registration: $700&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cars/x5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2005 X5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought this awesome BMW SUV. It was $72,000 new, and I bought it for 10% of that. It was large inside, had a panoramic sunroof, Bluetooth, and heated seats in the front and back. Perfect for Florida! It came with huge 20″ rims that are 315 in the back. I got lots of compliments on the wheels. The car was enjoyable to drive, the A/C was so cold, and it felt like it owned the road. It’s not a sports car, but it’ll scoot. 360HP in this SUV is no slouch. It’s got torque to tow as well. The gas mileage is horrific on this car, and it holds 25 gallons of premium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never bought new tires on it, but it had a TON of problems. The inside driver door panel was off for at least half the time I owned it, and I replaced almost every part in there myself. The window barely worked. I ended up using a zip tie to solder a piece of plastic together inside the door. The BMW and Porsche I had might have been lemons, It needed some engine work before I tried selling it private party, then ended up trading it in on this…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;8-2016-chevrolet-corvette&quot;&gt;8. 2016 Chevrolet Corvette&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Sold: Not yet, keeping at least 4 years!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MPG: 23/32+, premium gas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Insurance: $90/mo for excellent coverage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engine: 6.2L 8-cylinder, 455HP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oil Changes: None yet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taxes/Registration: ~$2,500&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/turo/vette.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Corvette&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newest car and by far the most expensive car I’ve ever owned. Something about lifestyle creep… I got a 1.49% interest rate 48 month car loan on a USED car. Found this 1-owner, higher mileage C7 Corvette at a dealer. It was the exact combo I wanted, blue exterior and brown/tan interior, 2LT, manual transmission. It was Certified Pre-Owned, so it has free oil changes and services for a few years, plus it was a better price than any 2016 for sale in the country at the time. I haggled for a while, got up to leave a few times, and got about 3k off the dealer price and got more than I paid for my BMW on trade in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2016 came with a front camera so you don’t hit the front bumper parking, and a flat bottom steering wheel. This is such a nice car, and I’m making some money on the side &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/rent-other-peoples-cars-with-turo/&quot;&gt;renting it with Turo&lt;/a&gt;. I was really tired of how expensive the BMW was and how unreliable it was, so I was happy to pay a premium to get into a reliable American car again. Plus it has cylinder deactivation to run on 4-cylinders when you want to, which helped me get 36 MPG on a road trip to Tampa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So those are the cars, I’ve owned, and the details on how much they cost to buy and own. Do you have any good stories about cars and how they effected your financial plans?

You can link all of your bank accounts, credit cards, investment accounts, mortgages, and assets, and it’ll track the values and balances over time. Most importantly to me, I can get a high level overview of all of my finances in one spot. &lt;a href=&quot;http://share.personalcapital.com/x/psOnBl&quot;&gt;Personal Capital&lt;/a&gt; will also generate a Net Worth for you, which is the sum of all of your assets, investments, and liquid cash, minus your credit cards, loans, and mortgages.

&lt;p&gt;For me, I have a TON of accounts to keep track of. I like to “churn” credit cards, which means to open new credit cards regularly for sign on bonuses. I currently have 6 bank accounts (1 is updated manually, but I don’t use this account often), and one cash account, which is the dollar bills in my piggy bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/PC/PC_cash.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bank Accounts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have my investments synced, which consists of Crypto, my 401k, my Roth IRA, my HSA, my individual stocks with &lt;a href=&quot;http://share.robinhood.com/roberts459&quot;&gt;Robinhood&lt;/a&gt;, and my taxable Vanguard brokerage accounts. &lt;a href=&quot;http://share.robinhood.com/roberts459&quot;&gt;Robinhood&lt;/a&gt; does not integrate with &lt;a href=&quot;http://share.personalcapital.com/x/psOnBl&quot;&gt;Personal Capital&lt;/a&gt; currently, so whenever I buy a new stock, I add it to my portfolio on the Personal Capital site. Stock prices and the shares you owned are tallied and added to your investment totals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/PC/PC_investment.png&quot; alt=&quot;Investment Accounts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have 15 credit cards on &lt;a href=&quot;http://share.personalcapital.com/x/psOnBl&quot;&gt;Personal Capital&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, 15, including Discover, Capital One, American Express, Citi, Chase, Bank of America, Barclaycard, and even one from my Credit Union. AND it syncs every single one of them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/PC/PC_credit.png&quot; alt=&quot;Credit Cards&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have my car loan and my mortgage synced. As far as assets, I have the value of my home, which can be pulled directly from Zillow, and the value of my Corvette. Some people add furniture, art, jewelry to their assets, but I don’t own much of value outside of my car and home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/PC/PC_loan.png&quot; alt=&quot;Loans and Assets&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://share.personalcapital.com/x/psOnBl&quot;&gt;Personal Capital&lt;/a&gt; also lets you get a list of all your transactions per account, and gives great historical data. This is a feature that I used heavily with Mint while I budgeted in college, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://share.personalcapital.com/x/psOnBl&quot;&gt;Personal Capital&lt;/a&gt; does just as good a job with it. You can see how much you spend per month, and on what types of spending. You can see trends on your spending, and set up budgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/PC/PC_transactions.png&quot; alt=&quot;Transactions&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main draw to &lt;a href=&quot;http://share.personalcapital.com/x/psOnBl&quot;&gt;Personal Capital&lt;/a&gt; over Mint is the investment features. &lt;a href=&quot;http://share.personalcapital.com/x/psOnBl&quot;&gt;Personal Capital&lt;/a&gt; will show you your asset allocation and performance over time. I even get an email every Sunday to see how my portfolio is doing. You can also setup email alerts for large transactions, such as when your paycheck arrives or your credit card bills are paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/PC/PC_assets.png&quot; alt=&quot;Investment Assets&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a Retirement Planner section, which will let you try out different scenarios. You can input your retirement savings and expected expenses, withdrawal ratios, assumed market returns, and when your house(s) are paid off, and also add in income events, like rental income, inheritance, and Social Security payments. As you can see, my plans aren’t finalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/PC/PC_retirement_planner.png&quot; alt=&quot;Retirement Planner&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also good mobile application for &lt;a href=&quot;http://share.personalcapital.com/x/psOnBl&quot;&gt;Personal Capital&lt;/a&gt;, and it supports 2 Factor Authentication (2FA), both on the web site and the mobile applications for Android and iOS. Personal Capital will even do 2FA for most of your accounts. I currently have 2FA with my mortgage, so I enter the code once a month when I want to see my principle paid down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/PC/PC_iOS.png&quot; alt=&quot;Mobile Application for iOS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if none of that convinced you that &lt;a href=&quot;http://share.personalcapital.com/x/psOnBl&quot;&gt;Personal Capital&lt;/a&gt; is a great idea for your finances, every single link in this post is a referral for it. If you join, we’ll both get a $20 Amazon gift card. &lt;a href=&quot;http://share.personalcapital.com/x/psOnBl&quot;&gt;Personal Capital&lt;/a&gt; does not keep track of your Amazon Gift Card balance (yet).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Personal Capital is a financial account aggregator, similar to Mint. You can link all of your bank accounts, credit cards, investment accounts, mortgages, and assets, and it’ll track the values and balances over time. Most importantly to me, I can get a high level overview of all of my finances in one spot. Personal Capital will also generate a Net Worth for you, which is the sum of all of your assets, investments, and liquid cash, minus your credit cards, loans, and mortgages. I use it daily to keep track of my spending and investments.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Rent Other Peoples Cars with Turo</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/rent-other-peoples-cars-with-turo/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Rent Other Peoples Cars with Turo" /><published>2018-04-03T14:05:14-04:00</published><updated>2018-04-03T14:05:14-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/rent-other-peoples-cars-with-turo</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/rent-other-peoples-cars-with-turo/">&lt;p&gt;I recently purchased a 2016 &lt;a href=&quot;https://turo.com/rentals/cars/fl/palm-bay/chevrolet-corvette/381353?s=-UnccSTA&quot;&gt;Corvette&lt;/a&gt;, a very nice, pretty expensive car. To help go towards the monthly payments, I listed the Corvette for rent on &lt;a href=&quot;https://turo.com/c/roberts974&quot;&gt;Turo&lt;/a&gt;, a site where other people can rent your car with insurance. &lt;a href=&quot;https://turo.com/c/roberts974&quot;&gt;Turo&lt;/a&gt; is sort of like a AirBNB for cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/turo/vette.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Corvette&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://turo.com/rentals/cars/fl/palm-bay/chevrolet-corvette/381353?s=-UnccSTA&quot;&gt;Corvette&lt;/a&gt;’s monthly payment is about $900/mo. $800 is the car payment and $100 is the insurance. This is the result of a ~$37,600 loan, 48 months @ 1.49% interest. That low interest rate is the only reason I even considered buying a car so expensive. I even traded in my barely running, always needing work 2005 BMW X5 4.8L on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://turo.com/rentals/cars/fl/palm-bay/chevrolet-corvette/381353?s=-UnccSTA&quot;&gt;Corvette&lt;/a&gt;, the trade in value + tax benefits was worth more than what I paid for the BMW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/turo/pup.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Corvette and my dog, Bentley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://turo.com/rentals/cars/fl/palm-bay/chevrolet-corvette/381353?s=-UnccSTA&quot;&gt;Corvette&lt;/a&gt; listed on &lt;a href=&quot;https://turo.com/c/roberts974&quot;&gt;Turo&lt;/a&gt; for $200/day, of which I get to keep $150/day after their insurance, fees, and taxes are taken out. So if I rent my car 6 days a month, the whole payment is covered. I’ve rented it 2 days so far in the first month owning it, to an older man from the county South of mine so he could play a prank on his wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/turo/turo.png&quot; alt=&quot;My Turo Listing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://turo.com/c/roberts974&quot;&gt;Turo&lt;/a&gt; service. I work from home, which makes it easy for me to rent my car, and I don’t need a car most of the time. I get groceries once a week, and that’s really as much as I NEED my car for. I’ll continue to have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://turo.com/rentals/cars/fl/palm-bay/chevrolet-corvette/381353?s=-UnccSTA&quot;&gt;Corvette&lt;/a&gt; listed on &lt;a href=&quot;https://turo.com/c/roberts974&quot;&gt;Turo&lt;/a&gt; and see if I can minimize my payment as much as possible while still having a nice car.&lt;/p&gt;
