I had already [blacked out the front grill](https://rskelton.com/Plasti-Dip-GX470-Grill/) on my GX with [Plasti Dip](https://amzn.to/2H7U2dj), and it is holding up really well and looks great, so I figured I would replace the rest of the chrome throughout the vehicle.

First, I replaced the front 4 windows weatherstripping trim with black trim. This was available on overseas models (Prado), and you can grab the parts on eBay. I wasn't particularly thrilled with the non-OEM quality of the parts I got from eBay, so I won't link them. To install them, just remove one Torx screw (I think it was T10) from the inside of your door panel, then remove the old part. The new weatherstripping trim slides in, then screw it in. I had to use a mallet to get it to sit right. Repeat for all 4 doors.

The back 2 windows I did not change the weatherstripping trim, as it involves removing the rear windows, and I didn't want to get into all that. I just Plasti Dipped it, along with the rear emblems. It took less than 1 can of [Plasti Dip](https://amzn.to/2H7U2dj) to do the entire rear of the car.

I taped a little of an outline, but it really didn't help that much. At least it comes off easy.

I did 8 coats, with 30 minutes in between.

Then removed tape and started cleaning with a damp cloth.

I do not recommend using an exacto knife like I did, I left a few small scratches in the paint. Use some plastic if.

The one time I wish the GX had a V6...

Now the only chrome left on the car is the Lexus logo on the front grill and on the rims. And the tow hitch. And the lug nuts. Not blacking any of that out though.
