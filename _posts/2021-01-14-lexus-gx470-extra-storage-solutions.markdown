The GX has lots of room, and lots of opportunities to better organize your stuff. Some people build drawers in the back or buy fancy [metal molle panels](https://www.ragofabrication.com/products/gx-470-modular-storage-panel-system-powder-coated). I went just a few cheap organizers off of Amazon, plus the [table I built in the back](https://rskelton.com/GX470-Rear-Door-Table/). 

I just bought 2 of [these storage organizers](https://amzn.to/3bETGud), I installed them on both sides of the center console in the front. We use them for storing our face masks, very 2020 appropriate. Once covid is over, not sure what I'll put here. They're held on with 3M tape, and if that ever came loose, some small black screws should do the trick.

I also bought a [Molle panel organizer](https://amzn.to/38HDwOM) that I keep on the drivers sunvisor to hold some pens and garage door opener.

I bought [this larger organizer](https://amzn.to/3ic3ptp) that fits perfectly over the rear drivers side panel in the third row using the included velcro straps. It is used for holding more pens, tire pressure gauge, emergency chapstick, flashlight, pocket knife, etc. I also have a great travel dog water bottle that doesn't spill.

And, of course, behind that panel is some more storage. I keep a small air compressor and my tow hitch stuff in here.

And finally, my wonderful [table on the rear door](https://rskelton.com/GX470-Rear-Door-Table/). Behind it, I keep some toilet paper, paper towels, first aid kit, [collapsable dog bowl](https://amzn.to/38OuOyB) (yeah, we travel with our dogs often), and the factory tool set is back there. I even mounted in a [bottle opener](https://amzn.to/35H2dJq).

All these storage items and the table build cost under $100, so a very cheaper way to optimize your GX's storage.
