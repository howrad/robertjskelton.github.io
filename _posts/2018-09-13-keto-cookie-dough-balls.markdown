### Ingredients
* 1 stick butter
* 1/2 cup Keto confectioners sugar, I use Swerve
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* 2 cups almond flour
* 1/2 cup Dark chocolate chips (or more), I use Hershey's Dark Chocolate Morsels

### Instructions
1. Get your butter to room temperature. I microwave it for 5 seconds on each side.
2. Put butter in a stand mixer and beat.
3. While still beating, add confectioners sugar, salt, and vanilla extract.
4. While still beating, add in almond flour, 1/2 cup at a time.
5. While still beating, add in dark chocolate chips.
6. Roll into balls and refrigerate.

### Considerations
* Do NOT use Coconut Flour. I tried using 1 for 1 coconut flour instead of almond flour, it was like eating a desert. Not a typo. A desert.
