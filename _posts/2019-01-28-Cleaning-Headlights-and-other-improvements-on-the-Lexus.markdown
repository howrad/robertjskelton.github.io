I've cleaned the headlights on my Lexus, using toothpaste and car wax. Materials included a tube of toothpaste with baking soda, some wax, an old toothbrush, and some rags. Simply spread the toothpaste around the headlights in a circular motion, similar to waxing. Let it sit for a few minutes, then wipe off with some damp rags. Then wax your headlights to apply a sealant on your lights. Toothpaste is not a good sealant.

I noticed a huge difference on the fog lights, which were really cloudy. The headlights themselves improved some, but they weren't that bad to start with.

I also installed a new [gas cap](https://amzn.to/2MBqzcI), which got rid of a few engine error codes, and some new [hood struts](https://amzn.to/2RSoajZ). The hood fell on me while I was changing some bulbs the other week, and I didn't want that to happen again. The hood struts took about 20 minutes to change, and I needed a 12mm socket.
