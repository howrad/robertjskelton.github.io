I recently bought this 2016 Miata, so of course, have to change all the lights to LEDs. This one doesn't have that many exterior bulbs to change.

* [License Plate Light: 194 x2](https://amzn.to/2S6HvcZ)
* [Reverse Light: 7440 x2](https://amzn.to/37n7l4t)
* [MX5things LED Strip](https://mx5things.com/collections/mazda-mx-5-2016-nd-st/products/red-led-strip-with-rear-harness)

The license plate lights are a little tricky to get out, but once they are out, just plug in the LEDs and check for polarity with the lights on. If they don't come on, swap the polarity before re-installing.

For the reverse bulbs, just reach under the bumper and give a quarter turn. There is not much slack in the harness for these, so you have to re-seat them before testing if they work. It's much easier to do with a second person to confirm the reverse lights are on - if you don't have a second set of eyes, just record a video on your phone when you shift into reverse.

For the MX5things light strip, I followed the install instructions [here](https://ssh16blog.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/red-led-strip-installation-instruction-v1.0.pdf).
