I installed a drop down rear table in my GX, it took about 4 hours and $10 of new parts, plus some some scrap and parts I already had. If you bought all new parts and wood, this would cost about $50. The cheapest table you can buy for the GX is the [Front Runner table](https://bluelineeo.com/products/drop-down-table-by-front-runner-1?_pos=1&_sid=d76aacddc&_ss=r&fbclid=IwAR2kTxwcdwTvTWkEN5io6CTTvupPVo2UFykXIjM-KEtGsIX1v0UTjxycjwM), which runs about $130.

First, I cut a piece of (nice) scrap plywood down to 40" by 15". I stained this with a natural stain.

Then I used a [30" piano hinge](https://amzn.to/2QmriTh) which I already had to attach it to the bottom of the rear door, using the included screws. This [piano hinge](https://amzn.to/2QmriTh) lets the table swing up and down while still being attached to the door.

Next, I bought a gate latch from Home Depot to secure the table in the up position. I secured this to the top of the door and the other piece to the table itself, making sure it could latch before I screwed anything together.

Great, now I have a table that can stay in the closed position, but won't stay level. I fixed that using some old rope, the same rope I used to make the rear door handle. I cut two holes in the outside corners of the table, and kept drilling into the plastic of the door itself. Here, I had to remove the rear door, for like the 10th time since owning the GX, and route the rope behind the plastic rear door cover.

I pushed the rope inside, put a very large washer back there, then tied the rope and covered it in electrical tape. While I was back there, I super glued the back of the piano hinge screws and the gate hardware screws as well.

Once the rope is secure behind the door, I put the door plastic back on, then routed the other side of the rope through the holes I cut in the wood earlier. I put another large washer on the bottom of the table, then tied the rope into a knot. Now you've got a finished, functional table.

I showed it to some friends (Kelley is frosted flakes), and they asked why didn't I stain it. I used a natural stain, but it was pretty light, so I pulled the wood back off and re-stained using a MUCH darker stain. Looks way better! While the wood was off, I rounded the corners where the rope runs through the holes, so that you don't walk by it and hit yourself on a sharp corner.

Once the stain was dry, I put the table back on the same way as before. The rear door pocket is still pretty functional! I can still store toilet paper, paper towels, and a few other things. The gate hardware has a spot for a lock, which I just put a [carabiner](https://amzn.to/2KBZxBr) in, so that it doesn't unlatch while driving. I also added some clear plastic bumpers onto the rear door plastic so that the wood doesn't run against plastic while driving.

I might cut the ends of the rope down a bit under the table, they're a bit long, but I'm leaving them for now just in case. I'm excited to use this table on road trips with our dogs!
