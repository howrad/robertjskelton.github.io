I bought a 1991 Suzuki Cappuccino, more on that later. First thing to do was an oil change. This is following [Larry's Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M3r7QcHHKA)

### Parts Required
* Oil Filter - I used a Fram FS4386. You can also use a [Fram FG4967](https://amzn.to/2W5Qmje) or [Baldwin B33](https://amzn.to/3292e7S), or others.
* Oil - about 3 quarts, I used [Mobil 1 5W-30](https://amzn.to/328lP8o).
* 17mm wrench
* [Oil filter removal tool](https://amzn.to/3276yEI)
* Drain pan
* Funnel
* Gloves, you definitely want to wear these
* Paper towels or shop towels to clean up

1. Drive car on ramps or lift the front end.

2. Remove oil cap in the engine
3. Remove oil filter, under the front of the car
4. Remove drain plug, slightly further behind the oil filter, with a 17mm, rotating clockwise!
5. Oh yeah, make sure you have a drain pan under the car. Let the oil drain for a while.

6. Add in the drain plug with a little bit of old oil, twist (counter clockwise) until hand tight, then tighten just a bit with your 17mm.
7. Lube the o-ring of the new oil filter with some of the old oil.
8. Add in your oil filter, just hand tight is fine. The oil filter removal tool doesn't work to tighten anyways.

9. Add about 3 quarts of oil using your funnel
10. Replace oil cap in the engine bay
11. Drive car off ramps, let sit at idle for about 5 minutes and watch for any leaks

11. If no leaks, check the oil level using the dipstick. If it is between full and low, you're done. If low, add more oil. If too full, that stinks. Repeat steps 1-11.
