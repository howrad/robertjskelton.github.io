In our new house, some of the closets are not very good at being closets. The closet in my office had a built in desk and no where to hang clothes, so I re-did the closet using the [IKEA Aurdal closet system](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/planner/aurdal-planner/?productId=S09331524#S09331524). We have an IKEA about an 1.5 hours up the road in Orlando, so I headed there to buy the materials I needed. I was planning on buying a white closet system, but in that 1.5 hour drive they sold out of the end pieces in white, so I ended up doing a grey closet. 

First step was to rip the old desk out of the closet. This desk was super overbuilt.

Then I patched all the holes in the wall and did some touch up paint.

Added more laminate flooring (the previous owners did not finish the laminate flooring in any closet, I guess they didn't have the right tool.

Then added new baseboards.

Then I assembled the IKEA Aurdal closet, 4 drawers, mounted them in there, and moved my clothes from the guest room closet into this closet.

I like this closet a ton, and will end up doing our master bedroom closet in the same way, lots of dense clothes storage. The master closet is also a pretty bad closet.
