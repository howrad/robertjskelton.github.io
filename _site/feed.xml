Here is a recap of my goals for 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;financial&quot;&gt;Financial&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Max out my Roth IRA ($5.5k) - PASS.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Max out my fiancés Roth IRA ($5.5k) - FAIL, we set up an auto-contribution, but ended up about 1k short. We still have until April to finish this goal, which we will.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Max out my 401k ($18.5k) - PASS, or really close.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Max out my HSA ($3.45k) - PASS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep 3k in an Ally Emergency Fund - FAIL, I had more than 3k in there multiple times but I always take it out. I use my emergency fund different than most.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have 30k saved in taxable investment accounts for a down payment on our next house - FAIL, reached 19k.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reach a Net Worth of 260k - FAIL. I hit 259.5k in June! The market fluctuated so much that I ended the year with about 255k.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have a total of 100k invested - PASS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;house&quot;&gt;House&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/pool-enclosure-replacement/&quot;&gt;Fix Pool Cage&lt;/a&gt; - PASS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Redo Owen’s Room - PASS. One of my roommates finally moved out, so we redid that room. It was pretty disgusting. About $600 in materials and some sweat and it looks amazing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Redo the kitchen - FAIL. This one is going to be expensive and I hope to get it done by the end of 2019. I did buy a much needed new fridge!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finish master bathroom - PASS. We installed new floors, vanity, tub, toilet, shower, etc. It’s nice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finish master closet - FAIL. The layout of the small master closet kinda stinks, so I want to redo the shelving.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/$500-bathroom-remodel/&quot;&gt;Finish 2nd bathroom&lt;/a&gt; - FAIL. We painted the cabinets and walls and put in a new mirror and fixtures, but have yet to do the floors or shower. That is a priority in 2019.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Paint outside of house - FAIL. I got lots of free exterior paint but never got the drive to actually complete this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Landscaping - FAIL. I put in some fruit trees and a lavender garden, but I need to put in tons more work outside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;education&quot;&gt;Education&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A in Educational Technology in Spring 2018 at Georgia Tech - PASS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A in Machine Learning for Trading in Summer 2018 at Georgia Tech - FAIL, I dropped the summer course because of the rigor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A in Health Informations in Fall 2018 at Georgia Tech - FAIL, I got a B. I’ll take it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get Elizabeth and my college diplomas framed - FAIL. It would take me an hour at Michaels and a few hundred bucks, but I haven’t done it still.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Obtain the AWS SysOps Administrator Certification - PASS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other&quot;&gt;Other&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Weight down to 200 - PASS, we started on the keto diet and I dropped from 220 to 195.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reach 125 of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beeradvocate.com/lists/top/&quot;&gt;Top 250 Beers on Beer Advocate&lt;/a&gt; - FAIL, I was at 102 at the start of the year, and they changed their algorithm. I ended up with about 90.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to church - FAIL, we went 3 or 4 times.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get engaged - PASS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/category/cars/&quot;&gt;Get a newer car&lt;/a&gt; - PASS…twice. I bought a 2016 Corvette and a 2007 Lexus GX470.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently got another car, my &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/drive-cool-cars-on-a-budget/&quot;&gt;10th car ever&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a 2007 Lexus GX470, basically a nicer 4Runner with leather and a V8. I chose this model specifically since it is a very reliable car, with an example of the same engine and chassis running for over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.motoringresearch.com/car-news/man-drives-toyota-1-million-miles-9-years-gets-free-toyota/&quot;&gt;1 Million miles&lt;/a&gt;. Mine only has 145k miles. I asked for an overnight test drive, and took it to pick up a delivery of laminate floors from Lowes before I even purchased it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/lexus/lowes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lowes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I always do to my cars is to replace all the yellow, halogen bulbs with lower power, higher output white LEDs. This makes the car look newer, and visibility is always better. The lights are all relatively easy to replace, you just need a small flat head screwdriver. Note that I did blow a fuse changing the vanity lights, and had to replace a 10A fuse in the fuse box located under the hood. You won’t have to do that if you don’t short the connection, so use something plastic instead of metal to remove those bulbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a list of lights I used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2S3FE8J&quot;&gt;Map Lights: BA9S x2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2UQpLoh&quot;&gt;Vanity Lights: 30mm festoon, thin x2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2S6HvcZ&quot;&gt;Courtesy Lights: 194 x4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2S6HvcZ&quot;&gt;Step Rail Lights: 194 x4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2S6HvcZ&quot;&gt;License Plate Lights: 194 x2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2SaufEu&quot;&gt;Overhead Lights in Rear and Middle Seats: 31mm festoon x2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Courtesy Lights
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/lexus/courtesy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Courtesy Lights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;License Plate Lights
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/lexus/license.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;License Plate Lights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step Rail Lights, before and after
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/lexus/step.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Step Rail Lights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Map Lights, before and after
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/lexus/map.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Map Lights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To replace the license plate lights, I had to take the rear door off. When I bought it, the handle on the inside of that door was broken, so I made a new one. I’ve seen some posts on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/LexusGXOR/&quot;&gt;GXOR&lt;/a&gt;, a great resource for Lexus GX mods, that involve making a new strap from a NATO bracelet or similar. I did similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/lexus/reardooroff.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Door Off&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a rope that we used to use for our hammock and cut it into 3 pieces. I braided it, tight, then ran it through the back. It’s tied up with tons of electrical tape behind the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/lexus/doorfix.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Door Fix&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/lexus/braid.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Braid&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/lexus/dooropen.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Door Open&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Front Door Remodel</title><link href="https://rskelton.com/front-door-remodel/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Front Door Remodel" /><published>2018-10-17T12:00:14-04:00</published><updated>2018-10-17T12:00:14-04:00</updated><id>https://rskelton.com/front-door-remodel</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://rskelton.com/front-door-remodel/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/frontdoor/5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally redid our front door for good, final product above. We had taken the door off, sanded and painted it about 6 months ago, using the same color “Swimming” as our laundry room. Problem was, we used the same bucket of paint as the laundry room. Interior paint. You can guess how well that held up outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the door after painting with interior paint. Notice the discoloration and bad spots. And the pups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/frontdoor/0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I bought the house, the door was pink/mauve. This is a picture from when I bought the house, the only picture I have of the front door. We originally redid it with new paint, weatherstripping, and hardware, but then had to repaint for good. That interior paint was not going to last on the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/frontdoor/before.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We re-did the whole thing - took the door off the hinges, took off the hardware, sanded, sanded, sanded. You can see all of the different layers: wood, pink/mauve from before, primer, and the interior Swimming paint. We took off different levels in different spots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/frontdoor/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/frontdoor/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/frontdoor/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then applied 4 coats of EXTERIOR Swimming - same color, but better for outdoor use. It’ll hold up much better this time. It looks much lighter with the direct light in the garage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ingredients&quot;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 stick butter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/2 cup Keto confectioners sugar, I use Swerve&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/2 tsp salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/2 tsp vanilla extract&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 cups almond flour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/2 cup Dark chocolate chips (or more), I use Hershey’s Dark Chocolate Morsels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;instructions&quot;&gt;Instructions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get your butter to room temperature. I microwave it for 5 seconds on each side.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put butter in a stand mixer and beat.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While still beating, add confectioners sugar, salt, and vanilla extract.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While still beating, add in almond flour, 1/2 cup at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While still beating, add in dark chocolate chips.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Roll into balls and refrigerate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;considerations&quot;&gt;Considerations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do NOT use Coconut Flour. I tried using 1 for 1 coconut flour instead of almond flour, it was like eating a desert. Not a typo. A desert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

When you go to a website, it’ll pop up if you can buy things and get cash back. You simply click “Activate X% Cash Back”, and you earn money in your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebates.com/r/ROBERT47769?eeid=28187&quot;&gt;Ebates&lt;/a&gt; account. The amount of cash back per store varies. After you earn $25, they direct deposit your money to your Paypal, or send you a “Big Fat Check”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ebates/udemy.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ebates&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last 1.5 years or so of using this browser extension, I’ve earned $226.70. Yeah. The main cash back has come from home improvement websites like Lowe’s and Home Depot, where I order online and pick up in store, or get items delivered if they’re big, like a vanity. Note that Home Depot no longer participates in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebates.com/r/ROBERT47769?eeid=28187&quot;&gt;Ebates&lt;/a&gt;, but they usually still have lower prices than Lowes in my area.  I have also earned a few bucks back from Udemy, where I buy training in order to get better at &lt;a href=&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/robertjskelton&quot;&gt;my job&lt;/a&gt;. I highly recommend the Acloudguru courses on Udemy if you work in any type of Cloud Architecture role. I even earned some cash back on buying my &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/optimize-everything/&quot;&gt;Chinese Roomba&lt;/a&gt; and on purchasing a refund from TaxAct!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ebates/ebates.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ebates&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d highly recommend signing up for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebates.com/r/ROBERT47769?eeid=28187&quot;&gt;Ebates&lt;/a&gt; if you do much online shopping, it’ll save you a bit more money, plus you can keep your Ebates cash along with your credit card cash back!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I started using Ebates in February 2017, when I really started putting lots of money into renovating my house.

The vanity I installed does not have the lever to pull up and down the stopper in the drain, so this style is a functional way to have working stoppers. Previously, I had normal drains, and I could not put the stopper down. They were attempted to be pushed down by a few guests, and eventually broke, so I decided to finally replace them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/drains/before.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drains&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I took the old drains out and cleaned the sink bottom, where the new drains would be installed. A lesson learned here is to clean the opening more than you think you should. It took me about 5 installs to get both drains working with no leaks, and each time I found more and more gunk to be cleaned. I’d recommend using an old, heavy towel or t-shirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/drains/drain_removed.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drains&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/drains/bottom_removed.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drains&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The install process of the new drain was pretty simple, I would recommend using &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2O3S4M8&quot;&gt;plumbers tape&lt;/a&gt;. I didn’t do this the first few attempts, and it lead to leaking. The new stopper works by pressing down on the top, and it latches closed. To open, just tap again.&lt;/p&gt;

I first heard of this from &lt;a href=&quot;https://retireby40.org/your-lifetime-wealth-ratio/&quot;&gt;Retire By 40&lt;/a&gt;, which he calls your Lifetime Wealth Ratio. Basically, it’s a way to how well you are investing, or if you’re overspending. I decided to run mine and see!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;social-security-earnings&quot;&gt;Social Security Earnings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get your social security earnings from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ssa.gov/&quot;&gt;Social Security website&lt;/a&gt;, which I signed up for a few years ago, and my figures are below. Note that I worked at a water treatment plant making $8/hr in the summers of 2008, 2009, and 2010. In 2011, 2012 and 2013 I worked 3-5 months per year at an engineering co-op, earning $15.50-$18/hr. I didn’t work in 2014 (still in college), then started my first professional job in May 2015. I switched jobs for a 35% raise in February 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ss/ss_income.png&quot; alt=&quot;Social Security&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So 2008 to 2017, I made $209,044. Added in with my latest paycheck (August 2018), I’ve made $48,305 this year. This brings my lifetime total to $257,349.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;current-net-worth&quot;&gt;Current Net Worth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ss/pc.png&quot; alt=&quot;Networth&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current net worth is $254,500 (tracked with &lt;a href=&quot;http://share.personalcapital.com/x/psOnBl&quot;&gt;Personal Capital&lt;/a&gt;), which means I’m $2,805 BEHIND my Social Security reported income. However, I’m at a &lt;strong&gt;98.9% ratio of net worth to lifetime income&lt;/strong&gt;, which is pretty good at age 26.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how&quot;&gt;How?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason my ratio is this high is because of my great single real estate purchase. I purchased a 4 bedroom single family home in May 2016 for $170K, which is my primary residence. I’ve had 2-3 roommates for the last few years which almost cover my mortgage, which was a 15 year mortgage with 20% down. The house has also appreciated to about $250K, thanks to a strong market and lots of sweat equity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d also like to acknowledge how my family has helped. My dad gave me $5K to help on the down payment on my house, and loaned me $30K to pay back as I could. I paid it back in less than 6 months after &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/drive-cool-cars-on-a-budget/&quot;&gt;downgrading my car&lt;/a&gt; and putting every penny towards it. I also recently received a $25K life insurance check from my grandfather passing. 100% of that was put into investments and savings. Both of these benefits gave me a head start, and its something I’m very thankful for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m doing pretty well at &lt;strong&gt;98.9%&lt;/strong&gt; of my lifetime earnings still attributed to me in assets, investments, or cash.

&lt;p&gt;In the last year, I’ve helped my fiancé raise her credit score from ~580 to ~720, and my credit score is over 800. Credit scores are a number that lenders take into account when offering you loans, and can make a huge difference when buying a house. A high credit score will get you a lower interest rate, which can add up to tens of thousands of dollars over the life of a mortgage. It takes time to increase your credit score, but it is very simple to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit scores take into account many things, but one of the most important and easiest to change is credit utilization, which is how much you’ve spent vs how much you have available. The goal is to decrease the amount you owe, and increase the amount you can borrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Sign up for a credit monitoring service.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.creditkarma.com&quot;&gt;CreditKarma&lt;/a&gt; since it is 100% free and updates every two weeks. Lots of credit cards will provide credit scores and monitoring as well, but I still use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.creditkarma.com&quot;&gt;CreditKarma&lt;/a&gt;. The goal is to see what lines of credit you have open, and things you can do to improve your credit score. When checking my fiancé’s, we found out she was an Authorized User on one of her parents cards with high utilization. We got her parents to remove her from that, which helped decrease the overall utilization of her lines of credit, which helped increase her credit score. You might find something on your credit report you did not know about!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/credit/score.png&quot; alt=&quot;Score&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Start getting Credit Cards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re just starting out with credit, you’ll want no annual fee, easy to obtain credit cards. The first three credit cards my fiancé got were no annual fee, easy to get, simple rewards, and we applied for them about 3-4 months apart. These 3 cards are considered some of the best beginning cards. When you get your card, setup auto-pay and link them into your &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/personal-capital-review/&quot;&gt;Personal Capital&lt;/a&gt; account, which is also highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/credit/big3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Big 3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.referyourchasecard.com/2/G2SA4SQQGR&quot;&gt;Chase Freedom&lt;/a&gt; - $150 sign on bonus, 1% back on all purchases, 5% on rotating categories. My fiancé got a $1,500 line of credit on this one, her first card.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citi.com/credit-cards/credit-card-details/citi.action?ID=citi-double-cash-credit-card&quot;&gt;Citi Double Cash&lt;/a&gt; - No sign on, but 2% back on all purchases. My fiancé got a $1,200 line of credit on this one, her second card, so now she had $2,700 of total credit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://refer.discover.com/s/zmk6g&quot;&gt;Discover IT&lt;/a&gt; - $50 sign on bonus, 1% back on all purchases and 5% on rotating categories, just like the Chase Freedom, HOWEVER! Your first year, Discover matches all your cash back, which effectively makes this a 2% everything, 10% rotating categories card for 1 year. My fiancé got a $5,500 line of credit on this one, her third card, so now she has $8,200 of total credit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that her total credit available is increasing substantially, but her spending stays about the same. If she spent $1,000/mo, with her only 1 credit card, she is using $1,000 / $1,500, or ~67% of her total credit. Now that she has 3 cards and more available credit, her new credit utilization is $1,000 / $8,200, or just 12% of her credit. It’s best to keep this number as low as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Other Things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep your Cards Open&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should always keep your no-annual fee credit cards open, even if you stop using them, since it will increase the average credit line age. One of my favorite cards, the Sallie Mae Barclaycard, removed the majority of good cash back benefits from the card. I still have the card open, but haven’t spent a penny on it since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be reasonable when applying for new cards.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t apply for credit cards you don’t think you’ll get approved for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep Tabs on Your Spending&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always track your cards, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/personal-capital-review/&quot;&gt;Personal Capital&lt;/a&gt; or in Mint. You can see some of my cards and their credit limits below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/credit/pc.png&quot; alt=&quot;Credit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bills in Your Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other things you can do to increase your credit is to have utility bills in your name, so if you’re renting a house, put the utilities in your name. Always set up auto-pay to make sure your bills are paid in full, every month. Months and years of no missed payments will help your credit as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you start getting into the world of Annual Fee cards and churning, this guide might not be for you. :) For further reading see, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/churning&quot;&gt;/r/churning&lt;/a&gt;, this is for those who don’t mind juggling 20+ cards to gain tons of airline miles and points, not for the faint of heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These simple steps will help get your credit score up and will save you money when applying for loans that matter, such as car and home loans. My 800+ credit score helped me secure a low mortgage rate (3.25%) and a low car loan rate (1.49%). A high credit score will save you money over time, and is simple to get high and keep high.&lt;/p&gt;
