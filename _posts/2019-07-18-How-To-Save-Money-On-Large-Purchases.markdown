If you do any amount of online shopping, using some of the following tips can save you some money!

# Rakuten

First is Rakuten, formerly called Ebates. This is a browser extension that helps you to earn cash back on purchases at certain retailers. It will also suggest other retailers if you can get the same item at a cheaper price. I have [wrote about Rakuten before](https://rskelton.com/using-rakuten-for-more-cashback), and I've earned about $350 in cash back since 2016.

# Credit Card Cash Back
This one is obvious, but you can pay with credit cards to earn some more cash back. BUT, some cards have rotating categories, so will give higher percentage cash back at certain retailers, but only during certain quarters. The Chase Freedom and Discover IT cards are examples of these cards.

# Honey

# Home Depot and Lowe's 10% Off Codes

# Slickdeals

# CamelCamelCamel
This is one I don't use that often, since I don't a ton of Amazon shopping, but [CamelCamelCamel](https://camelcamelcamel.com/) is a Amazon price history. You can install it as a browser extension, and see the price of an item over time. Honey does a lot of the same things.
