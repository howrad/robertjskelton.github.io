I first heard of this from &lt;a href=&quot;https://retireby40.org/your-lifetime-wealth-ratio/&quot;&gt;Retire By 40&lt;/a&gt;, which he calls your Lifetime Wealth Ratio. Basically, it’s a way to how well you are investing, or if you’re overspending. I decided to run mine and see!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;social-security-earnings&quot;&gt;Social Security Earnings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get your social security earnings from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ssa.gov/&quot;&gt;Social Security website&lt;/a&gt;, which I signed up for a few years ago, and my figures are below. Note that I worked at a water treatment plant making $8/hr in the summers of 2008, 2009, and 2010. In 2011, 2012 and 2013 I worked 3-5 months per year at an engineering co-op, earning $15.50-$18/hr. I didn’t work in 2014 (still in college), then started my first professional job in May 2015. I switched jobs for a 35% raise in February 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ss/ss_income.png&quot; alt=&quot;Social Security&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So 2008 to 2017, I made $209,044. Added in with my latest paycheck (August 2018), I’ve made $48,305 this year. This brings my lifetime total to $257,349.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;current-net-worth&quot;&gt;Current Net Worth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ss/pc.png&quot; alt=&quot;Networth&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current net worth is $254,500 (tracked with &lt;a href=&quot;http://share.personalcapital.com/x/psOnBl&quot;&gt;Personal Capital&lt;/a&gt;), which means I’m $2,805 BEHIND my Social Security reported income. However, I’m at a &lt;strong&gt;98.9% ratio of net worth to lifetime income&lt;/strong&gt;, which is pretty good at age 26. The only reason my ratio is this high is because of my great single real estate purchase. I purchased a 4 bedroom single family home in May 2016 for $170K, which is my primary residence. I’ve had 2-3 roommates for the last few years which almost cover my mortgage, which was a 15 year mortgage with 20% down. The house has also appreciated to about $250K, thanks to a strong market and lots of sweat equity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m doing pretty well at &lt;strong&gt;98.9%&lt;/strong&gt; of my lifetime earnings still attributed to me in assets, investments, or cash. How are you doing?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">A cool metric to track your net worth is against your lifetime earnings, of which you can pull from your social security income.

&lt;p&gt;In the last year, I’ve helped my fiancé raise her credit score from ~580 to ~720, and my credit score is over 800. Credit scores are a number that lenders take into account when offering you loans, and can make a huge difference when buying a house. A high credit score will get you a lower interest rate, which can add up to tens of thousands of dollars over the life of a mortgage. It takes time to increase your credit score, but it is very simple to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit scores take into account many things, but one of the most important and easiest to change is credit utilization, which is how much you’ve spent vs how much you have available. The goal is to decrease the amount you owe, and increase the amount you can borrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Sign up for a credit monitoring service.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.creditkarma.com&quot;&gt;CreditKarma&lt;/a&gt; since it is 100% free and updates every two weeks. Lots of credit cards will provide credit scores and monitoring as well, but I still use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.creditkarma.com&quot;&gt;CreditKarma&lt;/a&gt;. The goal is to see what lines of credit you have open, and things you can do to improve your credit score. When checking my fiancé’s, we found out she was an Authorized User on one of her parents cards with high utilization. We got her parents to remove her from that, which helped decrease the overall utilization of her lines of credit, which helped increase her credit score. You might find something on your credit report you did not know about!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/credit/score.png&quot; alt=&quot;Score&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Start getting Credit Cards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re just starting out with credit, you’ll want no annual fee, easy to obtain credit cards. The first three credit cards my fiancé got were no annual fee, easy to get, simple rewards, and we applied for them about 3-4 months apart. These 3 cards are considered some of the best beginning cards. When you get your card, setup auto-pay and link them into your &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/personal-capital-review/&quot;&gt;Personal Capital&lt;/a&gt; account, which is also highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/credit/big3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Big 3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.referyourchasecard.com/2/G2SA4SQQGR&quot;&gt;Chase Freedom&lt;/a&gt; - $150 sign on bonus, 1% back on all purchases, 5% on rotating categories. My fiancé got a $1,500 line of credit on this one, her first card.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citi.com/credit-cards/credit-card-details/citi.action?ID=citi-double-cash-credit-card&quot;&gt;Citi Double Cash&lt;/a&gt; - No sign on, but 2% back on all purchases. My fiancé got a $1,200 line of credit on this one, her second card, so now she had $2,700 of total credit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://refer.discover.com/s/zmk6g&quot;&gt;Discover IT&lt;/a&gt; - $50 sign on bonus, 1% back on all purchases and 5% on rotating categories, just like the Chase Freedom, HOWEVER! Your first year, Discover matches all your cash back, which effectively makes this a 2% everything, 10% rotating categories card for 1 year. My fiancé got a $5,500 line of credit on this one, her third card, so now she has $8,200 of total credit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that her total credit available is increasing substantially, but her spending stays about the same. If she spent $1,000/mo, with her only 1 credit card, she is using $1,000 / $1,500, or ~67% of her total credit. Now that she has 3 cards and more available credit, her new credit utilization is $1,000 / $8,200, or just 12% of her credit. It’s best to keep this number as low as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Other Things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep your Cards Open&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should always keep your no-annual fee credit cards open, even if you stop using them, since it will increase the average credit line age. One of my favorite cards, the Sallie Mae Barclaycard, removed the majority of good cash back benefits from the card. I still have the card open, but haven’t spent a penny on it since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be reasonable when applying for new cards.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t apply for credit cards you don’t think you’ll get approved for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep Tabs on Your Spending&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always track your cards, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/personal-capital-review/&quot;&gt;Personal Capital&lt;/a&gt; or in Mint. You can see some of my cards and their credit limits below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/credit/pc.png&quot; alt=&quot;Credit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bills in Your Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other things you can do to increase your credit is to have utility bills in your name, so if you’re renting a house, put the utilities in your name. Always set up auto-pay to make sure your bills are paid in full, every month. Months and years of no missed payments will help your credit as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you start getting into the world of Annual Fee cards and churning, this guide might not be for you. :) For further reading see, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/churning&quot;&gt;/r/churning&lt;/a&gt;, this is for those who don’t mind juggling 20+ cards to gain tons of airline miles and points, not for the faint of heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These simple steps will help get your credit score up and will save you money when applying for loans that matter, such as car and home loans. My 800+ credit score helped me secure a low mortgage rate (3.25%) and a low car loan rate (1.49%). A high credit score will save you money over time, and is simple to get high and keep high.&lt;/p&gt;

His name is Bentley, and he’s a wonderful dog! He weighs about 65 pounds, and stays with me while I work from home. I wanted to know exactly how much he was costing us, so here’s the expenses for our dog broken down. This post is also an excuse to publish tons of dog pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dog/pup.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bentley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purchase/Adoption&lt;/strong&gt; - If you buy a dog from a breeder, costs can be in the multi-hundreds to the multi-thousands of dollars. We adopted our pup at the Humane Society, and the adoption fee was $120. He was already neutered, had his first few rounds of shots, and was already healthy enough to be taken home at 8 weeks. I’m not going to include this one time cost in my yearly dog expenses, but it’s something to consider with a dog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dog/cake.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bentley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training&lt;/strong&gt; - We did a Beginning Puppy Training at PetCo, it was a little over $100. This class was really more about us (the humans) learning how to train our dog. Now that we have taken it, I think we’d do a good job at training any other dogs we adopt without paying for a class. This was also a one time expense, so I won’t count it towards yearly expenses. I highly recommend taking a class like this with your first dog so that you can learn how to train them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dog/lake.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bentley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2trGgLe&quot;&gt;Food&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - We buy a bag of dog food about every 5 weeks, about 10 bags per year. We buy &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2trGgLe&quot;&gt;Hills Science Diet for Sensitive Stomachs&lt;/a&gt;, highly recommended by every vet Elizabeth has ever worked for. Each bag costs about $50. We also give him lots of veggies, peanut butter, and table scraps, but they aren’t just for him. He gets all of the broccoli stalks and lots of baby carrots, those costs are more associated with us humans though, so counting those here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dog/barkbox.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bentley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barkbox.com/r/VLSI3YAX94&quot;&gt;BarkBox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -  We use BarkBox to get new toys and treats, but mostly to keep up out of the Pet Store. We’re pretty bad about impulse buying all kinds of treats and bones when we’re in there. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barkbox.com/r/VLSI3YAX94&quot;&gt;BarkBox&lt;/a&gt; costs $20/month, and has been very worth it for us so far. It usually has 2 toys, 2 bags of treats, and a bone, which would cost well over $20 at PetCo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dog/tango.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bentley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2MprawH&quot;&gt;Probiotic Powder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Bentley farts a lot. We give him 1 probiotic powder pack at breakfast to reduce that as much as possible, this is about $1 per day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dog/pool.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bentley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medicine&lt;/strong&gt; - Here’s where we have gotten lucky so far. My fiancé, Elizabeth, works for a veterinarian’s office. So far, we have received all of Bentley’s medicine for free! This saves us about $200 per year, so if your fiancé doesn’t work for a vet, don’t forget to consider for this cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dog/halloween.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bentley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vet Visits&lt;/strong&gt; - Required shots, yearly checkups, etc. Bentley has had issues with his stomach, so we’ve had a few costly vet visits already. It does help that Elizabeth gets all vet services for half price because of her job, so we’ve spent about $400 per year so far on this. It’d be more than double if we didn’t have that benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dog/luau.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bentley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;www.rover.com/refer/robers32904/&quot;&gt;Dog Sitting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - I stay at home with Bentley most days, and if I’m out of town then my fiancé or our roommates usually feed him, take him outside to use the bathroom, etc. The exception is long holidays when everyone goes out of town, like Thanksgiving or Christmas. We paid our neighbor $100 last year to watch Bentley for a few days over Christmas, and Elizabeth stayed in town on Thanksgiving. This year we’ll probably both be gone both holidays, so maybe $200 for dog sitting those two holidays. We’ve used &lt;a href=&quot;www.rover.com/refer/robers32904/&quot;&gt;Rover&lt;/a&gt; to watch other dogs before, and will likely look to utilize it again over the holidays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dog/lightsaber.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bentley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other&lt;/strong&gt; - I say we have the BarkBox to keep up out of the pet store, but we still go too much. I’d say on average, we spend $20/month on more toys, leashes, collars, &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2K9EhWo&quot;&gt;harnesses&lt;/a&gt;, dog bowls, treats, bones, a cage, dog bed, etc. We bought most of this stuff when we first got Bentley, but we still buy him new collars, more bones, and harnesses and leashes if the old ones get worn out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dog/hd.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bentley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total = Food + BarkBox + Probiotic Powder + Medicine + Vet Visits + Dog Sitting + Etc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total = (10 bags * $50) + (12 months * $20/month) + (365 days * $1/day) + $0 + ($400/yr) + ($200/year)+ (12 months * $20/month)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total per Year = ($500) + ($240) + ($365) + ($0) + ($400) + ($200) + ($240)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total = $1,945&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you go, about $2,000 per year for our full size Labrador, or $5.50 per day. So worth it. This does not factor in some large upfront costs, like adoption fees, puppy training, or some things you’ll need for your first dog, like harnesses, leashes, crates, dog beds, which will likely add up to over $500. Getting a dog is a big financial decision, but can be even more expensive if you have to take your dog to day care or don’t have access to benefits of a vet office.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">My fiancé, Elizabeth, and I adopted a black lab mix puppy from the Lee County Humane Society in Auburn, AL in April 2017.

One thing I like to optimize is my time. Here are 3 examples of how I do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-lawn-and-pool-care&quot;&gt;1. Lawn and Pool Care&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pay someone to mow my lawn, but not to do my pool. When I bought my house in May 2016, I mowed my own lawn with a terrible, 12” cut electric mower. It took forever. I paid the local pool store to do the cleaning and chemicals in my pool, which cost $100/mo.  After a few months, I decided to swap those services. Now I pay someone $65/mo to mow my lawn, and I learned how to do my own pool. I spend about $100/yr on pool chemicals, and I genuinely enjoy getting in the pool and using the vacuum. So by switching these 2 services, I saved $35/mo, which is $420/yr, minus the chemicals for the pool saves me $320/yr!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/optimize/pool.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pool&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-bought-a-knockoff-roomba&quot;&gt;2. Bought a knockoff Roomba&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we have a dog who sheds a bit, plus 4 people in a house, the floor can get messy, quick. I decided to buy a Roomba, but I wanted the nicest, best one on the market, which was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2KVWe6N&quot;&gt;Roomba 980&lt;/a&gt;. This sells for $8-900, but you can find them on sale and stack coupons to get them down to about $600. That’s more than I wanted to spend. I did a ton of research, and found the &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2s6N4NG&quot;&gt;Xiaomi Mi Robot&lt;/a&gt;, which I bought off some sketchy Chinese website for $280, with 2 month shipping. The Xiaomi Mi Robot is comparable to the Roomba 980, has an app, can be scheduled, controlled remotely, and is very smart in its cleaning patterns. When we finally got the vacuum, we named him Roscoe (yeah, we named our vacuum), gave him a label-maker name tag, and set him up on a schedule. Roscoe cleans the house every weekday at 2PM, and does a great job. This has saved countless hours of vacuuming so far, and all I do is empty the dust bin every 3 or 4 days. The house has never looked better!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/optimize/roscoe.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pool&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-walmart-grocery&quot;&gt;3. Walmart Grocery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used to shop at the Walmart Community Market, which is like a smaller Walmart with only groceries and household items. It was closer than the real Walmart, and you don’t have to deal with large crowds at the Walmart Community Market. Recently, the real Walmart near us started using &lt;a href=&quot;http://r.wmt.co/hKEvX&quot;&gt;Walmart Grocery&lt;/a&gt;, where you can order groceries online, set a time to pick them up, then when you arrive, a Walmart employee will bring them out to your car. There is no additional cost for this service. You park in dedicated parking spots on the side of the store, and never have to go inside. We started doing this at the beginning of 2018, and it’s amazing. I haven’t been in a grocery store in months, and I don’t impulse buy either! This also saves time and money. Use &lt;a href=&quot;http://r.wmt.co/hKEvX&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; for $10 off your Walmart Grocery order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you have it, 3 simple ways I’ve optimized my time and money in 2018.

It’s been written about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/&quot;&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://20somethingfinance.com/personal-savings-rate/&quot;&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; again, and everyone has a different thought on it.
I had never sat down and calculated mine, so here goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My money is moving to multiple different investment accounts. I have my Fidelity 401k through work, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.madfientist.com/ultimate-retirement-account/&quot;&gt;Optum HSA (Health Savings Account)&lt;/a&gt; through work, a Vanguard Roth IRA that is contributed to post-tax, I buy individual stocks through &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/robinhood/&quot;&gt;Robinhood&lt;/a&gt;, and a Vanguard taxable brokerage account that I put money in to save for a down payment on my next house. My income from work is $82,400 pre-tax, and is used for Savings Rate Calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note that these calculations do not include stock dividends, rent that my roommates provide to go towards my mortgage, or equity in my mortgage. This is my interpretation of a Savings Rate calculation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-savings-rate-calculation&quot;&gt;My Savings Rate Calculation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fidelity 401k&lt;/strong&gt; - I contribute 22% of my pay (as close to $18,500 as possible) and my employer contributes 7% = 29% * $82,400 = $23,896&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optum HSA&lt;/strong&gt; - I contribute the maximum allowed = $3,450/yr&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vanguard Roth IRA&lt;/strong&gt; - I contribute the maximum allowed, as I have extra money throughout the year = $5,500/yr&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vanguard Taxable Brokerage&lt;/strong&gt; - I add $50 week = $50 * 52 = $2,600/yr&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/robinhood/&quot;&gt;Robinhood Individual Stocks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - I stopped with automatic contributions here, I still add about $100/mo = $100 * 12 = $1,200/yr
Total Invested Per Year = $36,646
Divided by Salary = $36,646 / $82,400 = 44.5%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you have it, almost a 45% savings rate. Considering the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT&quot;&gt;average savings rate&lt;/a&gt; in America was 3.1% at the time of writing, I think I’m saving pretty well. It is difficult when checking the pay stub from work, seeing your income, but then seeing almost half of your income directed to other accounts you can’t spend. I’m glad I got into the habit of not taking my entire paycheck to a bank account!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Savings rate is always talked about in the Financial Independence / Early Retirement (FI/RE) space.

They cost $43 and a few hours of my time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bookshelves/pre.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bookshelves&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Materials included brackets and a piece of 3/4” MDF, cut down to 2 pieces of 9” x 24”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bookshelves/paint.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bookshelves&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were then sanded, given 2 coats of primer, then a final coat of Behr white paint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bookshelves/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bookshelves&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure to use a level on your brackets, both vertically and horizontally. I used a large textbook to guess how far apart the shelves should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bookshelves/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bookshelves&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lumber was $13, the 4 brackets were $30, and I already owned the paint and brushes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bookshelves/attached.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bookshelves&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the final product with some books! Total of $43 and about 2 hours of time.&lt;/p&gt;

Great gas mileage, easy to drive, hardly any issues in almost 60,000 miles! The window regulator broke on the passenger side, which was fixed at the dealer for $300, just out of warranty. The steering wheel column cover also broke, and the dealer wanted $600 to fix that, so I decided to see what I could do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fiat/removed.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fiat&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steering column cover is 2 pieces of plastic that sit around the steering column, and has openings for the ignition, wiper stalk, and turn signal stalk. The bottom plastic piece is attached to the column by 2 short screws (shown above), which sit on small plastic spacer sections of the lower piece. These plastic pieces are fragile, and broke about a year ago. This means the 2 pieces of plastic are just flapping around while driving, not secured to anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fiat/halfoff.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fiat&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took the entire assembly off, found 2 longer screws and washers that would secure the plastic bottom piece to the steering column. I attached both and tightened them up, but found that it made the ignition hard to use, and the turn signal stalk was obstructed. It was secured too tight. I ended up removed 1 of the screw and washer sets, so that just 1 remains, and it is as secure as it was when new, but it won’t break this time!&lt;/p&gt;
