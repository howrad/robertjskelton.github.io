I bought a [Teelevo Wallet Case](https://amzn.to/3momryf) for my [Pixel 4a](https://rskelton.com/Pixel-4a-On-Visible-Wireless/), since I've been carrying my S8/S9 over the last 3 years with built in wallet cases. I love not carrying an extra wallet. This Teelevo case advertises carrying only 2 cards, and I carry a Drivers License and 2-3 credit cards at a time, so I needed to increase that card storage capacity.

So what I did was cut out the rubber between the credit card slot and the phone, using an exacto knife. This took a few minutes with a new exacto blade, and brought the card capacity from 2 cards to 4-5 cards.

Plus the phone stands up on the case too! Highly recommended.
