I started using [Rakuten](https://www.rakuten.com/r/ROBERT47769?eeid=43662&utm_source=extension&utm_medium=raf_link) (formerly Ebates) in February 2017, when I really started putting lots of money into [renovating](https://rskelton.com/category/renovations) my house. [[Rakuten](https://www.rakuten.com/r/ROBERT47769?eeid=43662&utm_source=extension&utm_medium=raf_link) is a website and browser extension (I have it installed as a Chrome extension). When you go to a website, it'll pop up if you can buy things and get cash back. You simply click "Activate X% Cash Back", and you earn money in your [Rakuten](https://www.rakuten.com/r/ROBERT47769?eeid=43662&utm_source=extension&utm_medium=raf_link) account. The amount of cash back per store varies. After you earn $25, they direct deposit your money to your Paypal, or send you a "Big Fat Check".

Over the last 1.5 years or so of using this browser extension, I've earned $226.70. Yeah. The main cash back has come from home improvement websites like Lowe's and Home Depot, where I order online and pick up in store, or get items delivered if they're big, like a vanity. Note that Home Depot no longer participates in [[Rakuten](https://www.rakuten.com/r/ROBERT47769?eeid=43662&utm_source=extension&utm_medium=raf_link), but they usually still have lower prices than Lowes in my area.  I have also earned a few bucks back from Udemy, where I buy training in order to get better at [my job](https://linkedin.com/in/robertjskelton). I highly recommend the Acloudguru courses on Udemy if you work in any type of Cloud Architecture role. I even earned some cash back on buying my [Chinese Roomba](https://rskelton.com/optimize-everything/) and on purchasing a refund from TaxAct!

I'd highly recommend signing up for [Rakuten](https://www.rakuten.com/r/ROBERT47769?eeid=43662&utm_source=extension&utm_medium=raf_link) if you do much online shopping, it'll save you a bit more money, plus you can keep your Rakuten cash along with your credit card cash back!

# Update July 2019
I also [wrote about other ways to earn major cash back](https://rskelton.com/How-To-Save-Money-On-Large-Purchases/). And now I've earned about $350 back from using Rakuten!
