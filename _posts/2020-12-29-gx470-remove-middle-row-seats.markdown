We took our car on a 1800 mile road trip over Christmas with our dogs, luggage, and presents, so we wanted as much room as possible. I already have a [Yakima Skybox 16](https://yakima.com/products/skybox-16-carbonite) I use for trips like this, but this year I decided to take out the middle row. It was pretty easy to get out, a little more difficult to get back in. You just need a 14mm socket, here's how I did it. 

Pop the covers off the bottoms of each seat, there is 2 covers on the back and 2 covers on the front of each seats (8 pieces of plastic in total).

Take off the 14mm bolt or nut under each piece of plastic you removed.

Then you can remove the 2 seats completely from the vehicle.

Final step is to remove the two threaded parts from the outside of each seat.

To put them back in, just do the same steps in the reverse order. I found that barely threading on the rear bolts, then fully tightening the front of the seat bolts, then going to the back and tightening them down worked best. Also, for the plastic covers, the back cover with the cutout are for the part of the seat with the struts. 

That's about it, quick and easy way to get a bit more room on the interior of your GX470.
