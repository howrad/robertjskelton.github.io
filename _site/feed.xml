&lt;p&gt;I installed ditch lights in my GX today, it took about 3 hours and $250.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parts Bought&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ragofabrication.com/collections/gx470/products/2002-2009-1st-generation-lexus-gx470-ditch-light-brackets-1&quot;&gt;GX470 Rago Ditch Mounts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/31vmj4C&quot;&gt;2x Baja Squadron Sport LED &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2VYJoeI&quot;&gt;1x Add a Circuit Tap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dl/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ditch Lights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of purchase, Rago was having a sale. I bought the ditch brackets and Baja Squadron Sport pods with wiring harness for $235. You could do this install with any set of LED pods, but you’ll have to make your own wiring harness (with a fuse). The Rago mounts are great, so definitely use those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, here’s how to do it. First, install the brackets from Rago. This was a required first for me, since my brackets got here five days before my lights and wiring harness. I followed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F9legl29M4&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; to install the brackets, just take 1 bolt out at a time to make the hood not move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, put the lights on the brackets, follow the instructions there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, take apart all the plastic in your engine, if you still have it. The plastic that is. I hope you still have the engine. I took off the engine cover in order to remove the very back plastic piece that was hiding some wiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dl/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ditch Lights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dl/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ditch Lights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lay your wiring harness in place, you can even hook it up. You can take the red to the positive terminal and black to the negative terminal of your battery to test the harness and lights, just make sure the switch is one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now here comes what I thought was the hardest part - getting part of the wiring harness through the firewall. I decided to use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2VYJoeI&quot;&gt;Add a Circuit Tap&lt;/a&gt;, so I don’t plug directly in to the battery (which is possible). The part of the harness that connects to the splitter that plugs both lights in, I fed that part through the firewall from the cabin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do that, I cut a hole in the rubber nipple (where you see the white coat hanger in the pictures below) in the engine compartment on the firewall grommet thing. This is made for wiring expansions anyways. Then, under the drivers seat, push the wiring up through the hole that leads to the engine compartment. I found it MUCH easier to remove the plug (leaving just wiring and connections) and to tape those wires to a wire hanger that had already been pushed through the firewall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dl/5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ditch Lights&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dl/6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ditch Lights&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dl/7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ditch Lights&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dl/8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ditch Lights&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dl/9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ditch Lights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, got that done? Sweet. Bet it took a minute. Now you can make sure everything works. Plug in the lights to the harnesses, the black to a ground, and the red to power. I pulled back the plastic by the drivers left footwell to use a ground bolt there, you can see in the top left of the picture below. Then I used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2VYJoeI&quot;&gt;Add a Circuit Tap&lt;/a&gt; to tap the 30A drivers power seat fuse, which is in the small fuse box under the steering wheel. The switch should turn on the lights, and when the lights are on the switch should light up red. To hook up the included harness to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2VYJoeI&quot;&gt;Add a Circuit Tap&lt;/a&gt;, snip the end off the end of the red wire that was included, expose some of the copper using wire cutters, then push that wire into the end of the tap. Crimp the connection using some elbow grease and pliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dl/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ditch Lights&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dl/11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ditch Lights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your switch in the cabin, I had to remove the wiring for it to sit snug in its newly drilled hole. To do this, unplug all the wires (remember where they are), then run the wires up from the back of the hole. Then plug those wires back into the switch, out of the plastic, then you can put the switch where the hole is. I made my hole a little bit too big, so you can use tape or velcro or caulk or basically anything to make it a little more snug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dl/12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ditch Lights&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dl/13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ditch Lights&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dl/14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ditch Lights&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dl/15.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ditch Lights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a terrible hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dl/16.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ditch Lights&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dl/17.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ditch Lights&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dl/18.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ditch Lights&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dl/19.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ditch Lights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, just make everything pretty. I ran the interior wiring behind the plastic footwell. In the engine compartment, I ran the wiring for each light under the plastic piece by the windshield, so very little of the wiring is exposed. This was a little difficult to do, but looks a lot better. I also used zip ties to keep the new electrical running next to the old electrical, and behind that plastic panel I mentioned earlier. Reassemble your engine plastic pieces, close up the interior pieces, you’ve got some bright lights!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dl/20.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ditch Lights&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dl/21.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ditch Lights&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dl/22.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ditch Lights&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dl/24.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ditch Lights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason my install took so long was because I broke the connectors when I was putting the switch back together inside the hole, and had to crimp some new ends. Also I blew a fuse when testing. Then again, it’s electrical in a car. Have you ever done a electrical project in your car and NOT blown a fuse. Me either. The nice thing about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2VYJoeI&quot;&gt;Add a Circuit Tap&lt;/a&gt; that I linked is that it comes with lots of extra fuses, so I just replaced it with a 5A fuse of the same size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as the products, the Rago mounts fit perfect. You can have the hood opened or closed and the lights never touch your windshield. Some videos I saw complain about the wiring harness being too short, but it was long enough for my GX. The lights seem great so far, SUPER bright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dl/23.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ditch Lights&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dl/25.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ditch Lights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were to make this nicer, what I would have done is buy a new plate that converts your existing switch panel to have one extra blank from &lt;a href=&quot;https://sbeprecision.com/product/gx470-mirror-switch-plate-with-blanks-plus-2-switch-openings/?fbclid=IwAR2135GD3VnZ60hwcgVjCgGwLRl3IdyQAwuM_xPr2Y2IB22XYZAg6pRJnuU&quot;&gt;SBE Precision Products&lt;/a&gt;, and a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ragofabrication.com/collections/led-wiring-and-accessories/products/toyota-factory-switch-square?variant=40556182663&quot;&gt;Toyota OEM looking ditch light switch&lt;/a&gt;. That would have added $70 to my install just for a nicer looking switch, so I didn’t. If you go that route, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nWmIKTCtkY&quot;&gt;here is a good video&lt;/a&gt; on how to do the wiring - it is a little bit different but your switch is backlit, which is fancy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Lexus GX470 Blackout All Chrome</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/GX470-Blackout-All-Chrome/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Lexus GX470 Blackout All Chrome" /><published>2019-10-16T10:00:14-04:00</published><updated>2019-10-16T10:00:14-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/GX470-Blackout-All-Chrome</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/GX470-Blackout-All-Chrome/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blackout/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Blackout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had already &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/Plasti-Dip-GX470-Grill/&quot;&gt;blacked out the front grill&lt;/a&gt; on my GX with &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2H7U2dj&quot;&gt;Plasti Dip&lt;/a&gt;, and it is holding up really well and looks great, so I figured I would replace the rest of the chrome throughout the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I replaced the front 4 windows weatherstripping trim with black trim. This was available on overseas models (Prado), and you can grab the parts on eBay. I wasn’t particularly thrilled with the non-OEM quality of the parts I got from eBay, so I won’t link them. To install them, just remove one Torx screw (I think it was T10) from the inside of your door panel, then remove the old part. The new weatherstripping trim slides in, then screw it in. I had to use a mallet to get it to sit right. Repeat for all 4 doors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The back 2 windows I did not change the weatherstripping trim, as it involves removing the rear windows, and I didn’t want to get into all that. I just Plasti Dipped it, along with the rear emblems. It took less than 1 can of &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2H7U2dj&quot;&gt;Plasti Dip&lt;/a&gt; to do the entire rear of the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blackout/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Blackout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I taped a little of an outline, but it really didn’t help that much. At least it comes off easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blackout/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Blackout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did 8 coats, with 30 minutes in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blackout/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Blackout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then removed tape and started cleaning with a damp cloth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blackout/4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Blackout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not recommend using an exacto knife like I did, I left a few small scratches in the paint. Use some plastic if.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blackout/5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Blackout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one time I wish the GX had a V6…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blackout/6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Blackout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blackout/8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Blackout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blackout/9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Blackout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the only chrome left on the car is the Lexus logo on the front grill and on the rims. And the tow hitch. And the lug nuts. Not blacking any of that out though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blackout/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Blackout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Lexus GX470 Change Heated Seat Bulbs</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/GX470-Change-Heated-Seat-Bulbs/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Lexus GX470 Change Heated Seat Bulbs" /><published>2019-10-16T07:00:14-04:00</published><updated>2019-10-16T07:00:14-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/GX470-Change-Heated-Seat-Bulbs</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/GX470-Change-Heated-Seat-Bulbs/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hs/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;HS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the lights that provided a backlight to my heated seats on my GX470 was out, so I wanted to change it. I initially tried pulling the bulb out and replacing it with an LED of similar size, but the LED would not light up in any orientation, and the harness that holds the old bulb in was really difficult to deal with, so I just bought new bulbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up ordered a pair of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.superbrightleds.com/moreinfo/instrument-cluster-gauge/neox-led-bulb-high-power-instrument-panel-led/221/&quot;&gt;NEO3-RHP: 3mm NEO3-xHP Red&lt;/a&gt; from SuperBrightLEDs for $1.79 each. I figured, heated seat, should be red, right?.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hs/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;HS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install, pop the switch out of the dash with a small flathead screwdriver or plastic pry tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hs/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;HS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remove the connector from the wiring. You can use pliers or a clamp to hold it out of the dash, or else it will fall back in and you’ll probably have to use pliers to fish that connector back out. Then remove the cover that says L or R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hs/4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;HS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LED itself is the grey circle on the side of the switch. Use a screwdriver to rotate the old light to the left, the insert your new LED into the same spot, and rotate it right. Plug it back in and turn on the car to see if you have a light. If not, just remove the LED and rotate it to the opposite polarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hs/5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;HS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reassemble, attach the L or R switch cover, plug back into the harness, then push back into your dash. Done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hs/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;HS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Lexus GX470 Radar Detector Hardwire</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/GX470-Radar-Hardwire/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Lexus GX470 Radar Detector Hardwire" /><published>2019-10-07T07:00:14-04:00</published><updated>2019-10-07T07:00:14-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/GX470-Radar-Hardwire</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/GX470-Radar-Hardwire/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/radar/4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Radar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently put my Corvette on the market, so I took the hardwired radar detector out of it. Might as well put it in the GX!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used a &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2pSNAke&quot;&gt;RJ11 power cord&lt;/a&gt; that has a simple power and ground, with the goal to get power behind the mirror. It was ridiculously easy, the easiest of any car I’ve ever done. There are 2 wires behind the rearview mirror that are exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/radar/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Radar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/radar/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Radar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spot 1 there is a blue/white cord, and in spot 2 there is a black/white cord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/radar/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Radar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put your power from the radar cord (red) into spot 1 with the blue/white cord. Put the ground (black) into spot 2, the black/white cord. The prongs from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2pSNAke&quot;&gt;RJ11 power cord&lt;/a&gt; should fit snug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then wrapped a bit of black electrical tape around the power cord and the other wires running into the mirror, to keep everything from moving around too much. Plug in your radar detector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have power when the car is on, and the power drops when the car is turned off. Perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/radar/4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Radar&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/radar/5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Radar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrapped the cord once around my mirror, since it was a little long, then mounted it with the normal suction cup mounts, which aren’t great. If you’re doing any off road driving, you’ll want to take your detector down, or get a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blendmount.com/&quot;&gt;Blendmount&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2pSNAke&quot;&gt;Escort radar detector&lt;/a&gt;, these detectors have great sensitivity, but you can dial it back and customize them how you like them. I actually use an older model 8500 X50 that I bought for my first Corvette.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Lexus GX470 Custom Webbing Dog Divider</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/GX470-Custom-Webbing-Dog-Divider/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Lexus GX470 Custom Webbing Dog Divider" /><published>2019-08-09T07:00:14-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-09T07:00:14-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/GX470-Custom-Webbing-Dog-Divider</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/GX470-Custom-Webbing-Dog-Divider/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divider/26.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Divider&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a big dog, Bentley, a 75 pound lab mix, who loves being in the front of the GX when I’m driving. Only issue is, he’s a 75 pound dog. So I wanted a webbing divider to keep him in the 3rd row area, but the only one on the market that is made to fit the GX starts at $180! I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://raingler.com/collections/lexus-heavy-duty-cargo-netting/products/lexus-gx-j120-barrier-divider&quot;&gt;this product from Raingler&lt;/a&gt; as my inspiration, and started to plan how to make my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Raingler divider uses stitching for the joints, and I can sew, but I don’t have a sewing machine. The type of stitches used to sew together an intersection of webbing really requires a sewing machine (or thousands of hour of free time which I don’t have), so I found some other projects that had used grommets to assemble webbing. I decided to go this route, and purchased the following parts on Amazon, which ran me about $60.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divider/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Divider&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parts Bought&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2KpyTwR&quot;&gt;4x Frontmans Loops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/31vmj4C&quot;&gt;4x D Rings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2KBZxBr&quot;&gt;6x Carabiners&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2YUjQiP&quot;&gt;10-12 yards of Webbing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2KpSf4S&quot;&gt;Grommet Kit with 100 grommets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools Needed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hammer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scissors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lighter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drill with a bit that can drill through metal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For mounting the divider, it needs to have something to attach to on the inside of the car. I noticed the Raingler product added some mount points into the body, inside of the panels, so I did that. I pulled back the panels on both sides of the car, right behind the second row seats, and found 2 spots I could drill in to on each side. This gives 2 mount points per side, plus a 3rd mount point per side on the bottom of the middle seats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divider/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Divider&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divider/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Divider&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put 1 &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2KpyTwR&quot;&gt;Frontmans Loop&lt;/a&gt; at each spot, with about a 10” strip of webbing, with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/31vmj4C&quot;&gt;D ring&lt;/a&gt; on the other end. For making these connection pieces, I made them before putting them in the car. I cut a strip of webbing, then used the grommet punch to make holes. Make sure you burn off the loose strings on the ends of the webbing and the holes. Then, I used the grommet die to put a grommet in, with a Frontmans Loop on one side a D ring on the other. This was my first time using grommets, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2KpSf4S&quot;&gt;kit&lt;/a&gt; I bought was actually pretty easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divider/4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Divider&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divider/5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Divider&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divider/6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Divider&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divider/12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Divider&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divider/13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Divider&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divider/8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Divider&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did this for 2 spots on the drivers side and 2 spots on the passenger side, and fed the top connector piece above the panel, and the bottom connector piece between the 2 panels I had to pull off. The most difficult part of this whole project was drilling into the metal body panels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divider/9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Divider&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divider/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Divider&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divider/11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Divider&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divider/14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Divider&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided I wanted the webbing to be able to flex with the middle seats being up or down. Turns out, the distance between the mount point on the seats being up or down and the mount point I added was only a 2” difference, so I used the longer measurement. Here’s my chicken scratch measurements, I cut and built my divider using the bottom diagram. 34” along the top mounting points I added, 46” in the middle mount points I added, and 30” for the 2 mount points built in on the middle seats. The vertical strip from the top to middle was 21”, and from middle to bottom was 14”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divider/15.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Divider&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made the perimeter first, and made sure it fit on the mount points I had added and the back of the middle row seats. All fits! The hardest part was where 3 different strips intersected. I was worried the grommet would be too small to contain all 3 pieces of webbing, but it held great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divider/16.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Divider&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divider/17.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Divider&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divider/18.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Divider&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I added another horizontal strip and started adding a few vertical strips, putting grommets at every intersection along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divider/19.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Divider&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divider/20.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Divider&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divider/21.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Divider&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All done, then just install it! You can see the webbing flexes enough that the middle row can be up or down, however the middle row can not recline much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divider/21.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Divider&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divider/22.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Divider&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divider/24.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Divider&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took about 3 hours and $60 of parts to build a webbing barrier that is perfect for Bentley, and I have enough leftover parts, webbing, and carabiners that I could make a second one, or any other cool webbing things. I can also add many more vertical and horizontal strips. This was made to keep our lab in the back. We also have a 12 pound Cavalier, and she can fit through the nets, but that’s OK, she doesn’t get in my way when I drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any questions, feel free to comment, or ask me in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/LexusGXOR/?ref=group_header&quot;&gt;GXOR Facebook group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divider/dogs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Divider&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update, 1 day later: I had to add 2 more vertical strips, since Bentley jumped through them once he saw we had Chick-fil-A in the front seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divider/25.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Divider&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.  Insert a &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2OpmYmB&quot;&gt;USB drive&lt;/a&gt; into your Mac&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.  Open disk utility.&lt;/strong&gt; This is under Applications &amp;gt; Utilities &amp;gt; Disk Utility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/vette/1.png&quot; alt=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.  Eject the partition.&lt;/strong&gt;
This is listed below the USB Drive name itself, and has an eject button to the right. Labeled “2” in the picture above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.  Format the USB&lt;/strong&gt;
Click on the USB Name, then Erase. Select Format MS-DOS and Scheme “Master Boot Record”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Format the partition&lt;/strong&gt;
Click on the partition below it that was just created, then Erase. Select format MS-DOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/vette/2.png&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Add Audio Files&lt;/strong&gt;
Find your USB drive and drag and drop audio files onto it. Most people seem to recommend playlists, since those will play non stop in your Vette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Put in in your Vette&lt;/strong&gt;
Plug your USB drive into the USB slot either behind the dash, or under the center console. Either one works for audio, in a 2016 at least.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How To Save Money on Large Purchases</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/How-To-Save-Money-On-Large-Purchases/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How To Save Money on Large Purchases" /><published>2019-07-18T12:00:14-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-18T12:00:14-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/How-To-Save-Money-On-Large-Purchases</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/How-To-Save-Money-On-Large-Purchases/">&lt;p&gt;If you do any amount of online shopping, using some of the following tips can save you some money!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;rakuten&quot;&gt;Rakuten&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rakuten.com/r/ROBERT47769?eeid=43662&amp;amp;utm_source=extension&amp;amp;utm_medium=raf_link&quot;&gt;Rakuten&lt;/a&gt;, formerly called Ebates. This is a browser extension that helps you to earn cash back on purchases at certain retailers. It will also suggest other retailers if you can get the same item at a cheaper price. I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/using-rakuten-for-more-cashback&quot;&gt;wrote about Rakuten before&lt;/a&gt;, and I’ve earned about $350 in cash back since 2016. I recently needed to buy a new range and microwave, and the ones I decided on were about $1300 at Home Depot. My Rakuten extension popped up and said I could buy the same models at ABT.com for about $1100, and they give 6% back at Rakuten, which is $66 back!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ebates/rakuten.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rakuten&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;credit-card-cash-back&quot;&gt;Credit Card Cash Back&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is obvious, but you can pay with credit cards to earn some more cash back. Some cards have rotating categories, so will give higher percentage cash back at certain retailers, but only during certain quarters. The Chase Freedom and Discover IT cards are examples of these cards. A great example here is that for Q3 2019, which is the current quarter as I write this article, Discover is 5% back on Paypal purchases. As I was checking out at ABT.com for my new appliances (mentioned above), they had the option to check out with Paypal, so I did with my Discover IT card. At 5% of $1100, that is $55 cash back, on top of the $66 I got from Rakuten. So using Rakuten and the right credit card got me from $1300 to $1100 - $66 - $55 = under $1000! Nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;honey&quot;&gt;Honey&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://joinhoney.com/ref/dsskgi&quot;&gt;Honey&lt;/a&gt; is very similar to Rakuten, but I don’t think it does as good of a job at giving cash back. It gives cash back in the form of “Honey Gold”, which you can buy gift cards with. The nice feature of Honey is that it will automatically try coupon codes! Lots of  ecommerce sites have discount codes or coupon codes, that are sometimes not public. Honey has a list of these, and will try to use all of them. I like to get the discount code from Honey, then use Rakuten for their cash back. You can not earn both cash back through Rakuten AND Honey Gold. If you click on one after the other, one will pop up saying that you can’t earn for both cash back portals, so pick and choose which one works best for your given transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ebates/honey1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Honey&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ebates/honey2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Honey&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;slickdeals&quot;&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://slickdeals.net/&quot;&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/a&gt; is the classic website for finding things that are on sale. You can set up email alerts for items you are interested in. I did this with some $60 Sennheiser headphones that I knew went on sale pretty often. I set up the emails, and bought them a few months later for $28. This site is mostly focused on technology products, but there are tons of other products on here. I’ve bought some clothes and dry food products that I’ve seen on Slickdeals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;home-depot-and-lowes-10-off-codes&quot;&gt;Home Depot and Lowe’s 10% Off Codes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re making a large purchase at Home Depot or Lowe’s, it can behoove you buy online and use a coupon code. You can generate them, somehow (search the Slickdeals forums if you are interested), or you can buy them for a few bucks. When you’re spending $1,000 on flooring, it’s worth it to spend $5 to get a 10% coupon, which will save you $95. I’ve bought &lt;a href=&quot;https://lowescoupon.info/&quot;&gt;Lowe’s coupons here&lt;/a&gt; and found free ones &lt;a href=&quot;https://renovopower.com/lowes.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, though I am not affiliated with either website. You can also fill out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://moversguide.usps.com/mgo/disclaimer?referral=MG80&quot;&gt;USPS Change of Address form&lt;/a&gt;, and they send you a welcome kit. This usually includes a 10% off coupon to both Home Depot and Lowe’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;bumped&quot;&gt;Bumped&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bumped.com/?ref=8ad7cc96&quot;&gt;Bumped&lt;/a&gt; is an app that you give access to your credit card transactions, and you can earn stocks based on what retailers you shop at. You get a choice of 1 retailer per category, and they are called “Loyalties”. For example, Home Improvement is a category. I chose Home Depot over Lowe’s, since I shop at Home Depot much more. When Bumped notices a transaction on any of my linked credits cards from Home Depot, it’ll give me a small percentage of that purchase as a stock, 1% at Home Depot. There are tons of categories. I don’t ever count on this, but I set it up a few months ago and I’ve earned about $30 in stocks from just doing normal shopping. This is a new application, so the app is still a bit buggy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ebates/bumped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bumped&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;camelcamelcamel&quot;&gt;CamelCamelCamel&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one I don’t use that often, since I don’t a ton of Amazon shopping, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://camelcamelcamel.com/&quot;&gt;CamelCamelCamel&lt;/a&gt; is a Amazon price history. You can install it as a browser extension, and see the price of an item over time. Honey does a lot of the same things.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">If you do any amount of online shopping, using some of the following tips can save you some money!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Recipe - Keto Chocolate Milkshake</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/Keto-Chocolate-Milkshake/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Recipe - Keto Chocolate Milkshake" /><published>2019-07-12T09:00:14-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-12T09:00:14-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Keto-Chocolate-Milkshake</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Keto-Chocolate-Milkshake/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/recipes/milkshake.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Remote work offers some great benefits, but also some notable cons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.  No commute!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This saves so much time! You don’t even need a car when you have no commute, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/drive-cool-cars-on-a-budget/&quot;&gt;I have 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.  Work with dog(s)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife and I have 2 dogs, and I get to be at home with them all day. This means no hiring dog sitters, and our pups aren’t always bored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/wfh/dogs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dogs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Make Your Office How You Like It&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought multiple computer monitors, a nice speaker system, decorated my walls, and I can light candles every day! In a shared office environment, you just get what they provide, unless you want to drag it to and from work every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/wfh/office.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Listen to music without headphones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Music through speakers is better, and I don’t get tired of having headphones on or in my ears like I did when shared an office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Your Time is More Flexible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can cook lunch most days and have it ready when my wife comes home from work. If I get frustrated, I can go outside, clean, or go do a load of laundry. I have the privacy to make phone calls without having to find a huddle room or empty office. I can walk out of the office, get quotes from contractors, and can run errands easier than being in a shared office. There seems to much less of a stigma of taking time off from work when you are remote, as opposed to in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. No Dress Code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wear gym shorts and t-shirts to work every day. This can also be a con, since I usually look like a slob. It’s also a bit backwards, since I do most of my dressing up on the weekends, when most people dress down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. More focused working time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can get more high quality work in less hours than in a shared office since I no longer have people tapping on my shoulder for help, or co-workers stopping by to chat. There is no “office water cooler” when you work from home, which means less distractions while working. This can be a huge advantage when writing code, which is a task that requires lots of concentration, at least for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Work where you want&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually work at my office desk, where I have 3 monitors, speakers, mouse, keyboard, etc. A nice working setup. But occasionally, I’ll want to do training or take meetings and get out of that office. I can go sit in a recliner for a meeting in the living room, or sit by the pool to do some technical training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/wfh/pool.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pool&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Cabin Fever&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t notice being cooped up inside as a negative for the first 2 years, but in the last half a year I have been getting stir crazy. I seem to leave my house once a week, and barely get outside off of my property. It has been a recent goal of mine to start getting out of the house more often. I’ve started a trivia group on Thursdays to socialize more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Hard to Shut Off Work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have work email on my phone. If I see an email at 9PM, and it is something that just takes a second to do, I’ll go over to my office and do it. Downside, I then spend another 30 minutes doing other stuff, and I never seem to truly disconnect from work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. The A/C bill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have to pay my own power bill, and I live in Florida. That means that if I’m not running the A/C, it will get HOT inside. I keep it at 77-78F most days, but that still adds up. It used to keep the house at 80F during work hours, before I started working here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Less Reliable Internet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporate offices often have business internet connections, which are more reliable and quicker. I have a 150MB home internet connection, which is fast, but tends to be less reliable. I also had to supply my own internet connection hardware, like the modem and router. These are expenses I would have had normally, but when you’re home 24/7, you care more about a great internet connection than normal. Therefore, I bought a nicer, expensive router recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Less Connected to Co-Workers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a shared office, you can walk up to your coworkers to get advice or help, and you see them in person at meeting often. In a remote work environment, I occasionally see my team members on Skype video, but it’s usually just audio. We communicate mostly via chat platforms at work, which is a bit more difficult to get things done than if you are sitting next to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Conflicting off days&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife has Tuesdays and Sundays off. I work on Tuesdays. This means that I’m at home trying to work, and she’s at home not working on Tuesdays.   I also used to have a roommate that would have every other Friday off, and I worked those Fridays. He would sit around and play video games all day, which was annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Snacks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be a pro for some, but I’m always 20 steps from my kitchen, stocked with snacks and food. And I have terrible self control with food, so I am always snacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the last 2.5 years working from home have been a wonderful way to work (if you have to work), and I would take remote work over an in person shared office every day. I have learned a few lessons on how to manage working from home though, like setting boundaries on when to start and stop working, how to focus more and be more productive, and to talk to your team members more, even if it is just about their personal lives. Working from home is a great move in the IT and Software disciplines, and I’d recommend employees and managers alike to give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’ve been working from home full time for over 2.5 years, and it is a major benefit of my current position.

&lt;p&gt;My wife, Elizabeth, and I got married on May 26, 2019, and left for our honeymoon to Costa Rica the next day. We drove from Melbourne, FL to Ft Lauderdale, FL to fly on JetBlue. A direct flight from FLL to SJO, it was about $500 for both of us, and bags were included with my JetBlue credit card. We spent 7 days and 6 nights in Costa Rica, and visited 5 provinces: San Jose, Alajuela, Guanacaste, Heredia, and Puntarenas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/tacobell1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TacoBell&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;rental-car&quot;&gt;Rental Car&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rented a Toyota Land Cruise Prado (the Toyota version of my Lexus GX470) from National Rental Car in San Jose, but not at the airport. The pickup location was Hotel Marriott Costa Rica, which was about 10 minutes away from the SJO airport. We found a free shuttle from National at the rental car kiosk in the airport. If you pick up outside of the airport, you avoid a large airport pickup tax. We also used promo code “MEMPHIS” for 10% off, prepaid with a Visa Signature credit card for another 10% off, and declined the LDW insurance. Car rentals require both SLC and LDW insurance. However, you can decline the LDW if you have a credit card that covers it, and you print out and bring the credit card agreement. My Capital One Venture is a Visa Signature, so we paid with that. The Prado was awesome, and we only paid about $340 to drive it for a week. We put 850 miles on it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/prado1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Prado&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;day-1---san-jose&quot;&gt;Day 1 - San Jose&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landed in San Jose, got our rental car, checked in to Apartotel La Sabana. It was so rainy, so we did nothing but get room service and stay in. This place was $76/night, and was nothing fancy. The pool looked great (but it was rainy) and there was a sauna, but the room was cramped and not great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/view2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;View&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;day-2---san-jose-to-la-paz-to-heliconias&quot;&gt;Day 2 - San Jose to La Paz to Heliconias&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woke up and got a great Costa Rican breakfast at Apartotel La Sabana. That made the room worth it. We drove about 1.5 hours to the La Paz waterfall gardens, which was incredible. La Paz entrance was $125 for 2 people. We saw lots of birds, sloths, jungle cats, and beautiful waterfalls, and also had an awesome buffet. This might be our most recommended attraction we visited in Costa Rica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/lapaz1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;LaPaz&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/lapaz2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;LaPaz&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/lapaz3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;LaPaz&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/lapaz4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;LaPaz&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/lapaz6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;LaPaz&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/lapaz7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;LaPaz&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/lapaz8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;LaPaz&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/lapaz9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;LaPaz&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/lapaz10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;LaPaz&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/lapaz11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;LaPaz&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a lot of hours here, we drove another 2 hours (stopping at McDonalds along the way) to the Heliconias Nature Lodge, and checked in to their Deluxe Treehouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/mcd1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;McDonalds&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/mcd2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;McDonalds&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ordered room service, and enjoyed the awesome room! This room at Heliconias was $270/night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/lodge1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lodge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;day-3---la-fortuna&quot;&gt;Day 3 - La Fortuna&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woke up and had another great Costa Rican breakfast at the Heliconias Nature Lodge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/lodge2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lodge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drove in to La Fortuna and did some white water rafting with the Desafio Adventure Company down the Balsa River. Afterwards, they provided a lunch buffet at their restaurant. This trip was $150 for 2 people, which we though was a great value. The guides and the food were great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/lodge3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lodge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/lodge4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lodge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We drove back to the Nature Lodge, relaxed a bit, then drove back in to La Fortuna to visit the EcoTermales Hot Springs. It was $80 for 2 people. We loved the hot springs, but were disappointed with the food. We paid $20 each for a below average buffet. Other than the food, the hot springs were awesome. Great drinks, not too crowded, lots of hot water. Then we drove back to the Nature Lodge and went to sleep early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/hs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ecotermales&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;day-4---la-fortuna-to-secrets&quot;&gt;Day 4 - La Fortuna to Secrets&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woke up super early and went on a 6AM Bird Watching Tour, which cost $135 for 2 people and included some fruit. We saw lots of local birds (and dogs) and our guide was very knowledgable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/bird1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bird&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/bird2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bird&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This close up picture of a bird is a Motmot, taken on a Galaxy S8 through a monocular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/bird3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bird&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, we had another Costa Rican breakfast at Heliconias Nature Lodge. The staff here was super friendly. We checked out of this hotel and drove to the La Fortuna Waterfall. It was a ton of stairs to get there, but it was beautiful. It poured here, but luckily not until we were about ready to leave. The waterfall entrance was $36 for 2 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/lafortuna1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;La Fortuna&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/lafortuna2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;La Fortuna&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/lafortuna3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;La Fortuna&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/lafortuna4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;La Fortuna&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we drove to the Mistico Arenal Hanging Bridges Park. This place was actually closed for bad weather when we got there, so we got some food at their restaurant, and they opened about 30 minutes later. There are lots of hanging suspension bridges, great views of the Arenal volcano, and wildlife. It involved lots of hiking. We were already pretty exhausted from all the walking and hiking we had done the last few days, so we didn’t even see the whole park. We did see coati though, which we had never seen before! Mistico was $80 for 2 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/mistico1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mistico&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/mistico2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mistico&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/mistico3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mistico&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/mistico4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mistico&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/mistico5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mistico&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/mistico6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mistico&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/mistico7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mistico&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, we drove to the Secrets Papagayo resort, about a 3 hour drive. Google Maps sent us down this insane mud road that was about 60 degrees uphill. Our car could handle it, but I could not. We turned around and took a detour, which added about 30 minutes. We got to our resort pretty late at night, and checked in to our room. They had prepped it for our honeymoon, with a sign and a bottle of champage!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/secrets1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Secrets1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;day-5---secrets&quot;&gt;Day 5 - Secrets&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all inclusive resort was full of other couples on their honeymoons, and that was about it. Everyone had a honeymoon on their door! It was $430/night for 2 people, and of course included all of our food and drinks. So that’s what we did. We ate and drank and sat by the pool. We ordered room service, like 5 times. Then we went to their spa that night, my first time at a spa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/secrets2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Secrets1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/secrets3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Secrets1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/secrets4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Secrets1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/secrets5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Secrets1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;day-6---drive-back-to-san-jose&quot;&gt;Day 6 - Drive back to San Jose&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We just drove from Secrets back to San Jose this day. We stopped at another Taco Bell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/tacobell2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TacoBell&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed at the AC Hotel, which my Dad bought for us as a gift using points. Well, he is some sort of fancy membership level at Marriott, so they upgraded us to their penthouse suite and gave us free breakfast! It was probably one of the coolest hotel rooms we’ve every stayed in. It had a bedroom, living room, kitchen, 1.5 baths, and the biggest master bathroom I’ve ever been in. We walked around the area that the hotel was in, which is a new upscale shopping area. They also had a Lexus dealer with a LFA in stock. We ate dinner at PF Chang’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/sanjose1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;San Jose&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/sanjose2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;San Jose&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/sanjose3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;San Jose&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/sanjose4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;San Jose&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;day-7---return-home&quot;&gt;Day 7 - Return home&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breakfast buffet at the AC Hotel was great. We checked out of the hotel late, dropped off the car at National, then got a ride on their shuttle to the airport. We ate at Smashburger, which was crazy expensive. Like $20 for a burger. We also tried a few local beers in the airport. Landed in FLL later, then drove back to Melbourne to get a few hours sleep before work the next day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/sanjose5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;San Jose&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cr/beer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;other-things-to-know-about-costa-rica&quot;&gt;Other things to know about Costa Rica&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring a credit card with no foreign transaction fees, we used my Capital One Venture Card for everything. The drive from Papagayo (west coast) to San Jose has toll roads you have to pay with cash. You can pay with USD and get change back in colones, the local currency. When driving, there are many 1 lane bridges. There is a sign on one side that shows which side has to yield, and the side without a yield sign gets to go without yielding. The roads are all very windy. Our rental took diesel, and all of the gas stations were not self serve. They had an attendant who would fill you up. People who work in the hospitality and tourism industry in Costa Rica are very nice and, in general, have very good English. We did not know much Spanish, but only had to bring out Google Translate once. Download Google Maps and Google Translate for offline usage fore you go if you have limited international data, like we did. We used 0MB of data the whole week, since each hotel had Wifi.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
