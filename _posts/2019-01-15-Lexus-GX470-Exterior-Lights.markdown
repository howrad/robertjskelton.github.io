I wrote about [installing new Interior LEDs](https://rskelton.com/Lexus-GX470-LED-Interior-Lights/) on my Lexus GX470, and here's my post on the exterior lights.

Here's a list of lights I used, you need 2 of each bulb:
* [H11 - Low Beams](https://amzn.to/2SUTGdu)
* [9005 - High Beams](https://amzn.to/2FyBJgO)
* [H3 - Fog Lights](https://amzn.to/2sv2Dyq)
* [7440 - Reverse Lights](https://amzn.to/2SWAmN5)

I'd like to thank the kind members of the [GXOR Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/LexusGXOR) for their suggestions. [Here](http://www.pfranleds.com/gx-470-1/) is a handy website for all the light bulbs in a GX470.
