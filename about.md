I am a [Sr Infrastructure Architect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertjskelton/) at [GE Transportation](https://www.getransportation.com) based in Palm Bay, FL. I earned a BS in Computer Engineering from Auburn University in May 2015, and I'll complete a MS in Computer Science from Georgia Tech sometime in 2020. My expertise is in automation with Chef, and with architecture in AWS.

My favorite topics are [finance](https://rskelton.com/category/finance/), [technology](https://rskelton.com/category/tech/), craft beer, [college football](https://rskelton.com/football), [cars](https://rskelton.com/category/cars/), and [home renovations](https://rskelton.com/category/renovations/).
