&lt;p&gt;I recently got another car, my &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/drive-cool-cars-on-a-budget/&quot;&gt;10th car ever&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a 2007 Lexus GX470, basically a nicer 4Runner with leather and a V8. I chose this model specifically since it is a very reliable car, with an example of the same engine and chassis running for over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.motoringresearch.com/car-news/man-drives-toyota-1-million-miles-9-years-gets-free-toyota/&quot;&gt;1 Million miles&lt;/a&gt;. Mine only has 145k miles. I asked for an overnight test drive, and took it to pick up a delivery of laminate floors from Lowes before I even purchased it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/lexus/lowes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lowes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I always do to my cars is to replace all the yellow, halogen bulbs with lower power, higher output white LEDs. This makes the car look newer, and visibility is always better. The lights are all relatively easy to replace, you just need a small flat head screwdriver. Note that I did blow a fuse changing the vanity lights, and had to replace a 10A fuse in the fuse box located under the hood. You won’t have to do that if you don’t short the connection, so use something plastic instead of metal to remove those bulbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a list of lights I used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2S3FE8J&quot;&gt;Map Lights: BA9S x2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2UQpLoh&quot;&gt;Vanity Lights: 30mm festoon, thin x2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2S6HvcZ&quot;&gt;Courtesy Lights: 194 x4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2S6HvcZ&quot;&gt;Step Rail Lights: 194 x4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2S6HvcZ&quot;&gt;License Plate Lights: 194 x2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2SaufEu&quot;&gt;Overhead Lights in Rear and Middle Seats: 31mm festoon x2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Courtesy Lights

&lt;img src=&quot;/images/lexus/map.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Map Lights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To replace the license plate lights, I had to take the rear door off. When I bought it, the handle on the inside of that door was broken, so I made a new one. I’ve seen some posts on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/LexusGXOR/&quot;&gt;GXOR&lt;/a&gt;, a great resource for Lexus GX mods, that involve making a new strap from a NATO bracelet or similar. I did similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/lexus/reardooroff.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Door Off&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a rope that we used to use for our hammock and cut it into 3 pieces. I braided it, tight, then ran it through the back. It’s tied up with tons of electrical tape behind the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/lexus/doorfix.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Door Fix&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally redid our front door for good, final product above. We had taken the door off, sanded and painted it about 6 months ago, using the same color “Swimming” as our laundry room. Problem was, we used the same bucket of paint as the laundry room. Interior paint. You can guess how well that held up outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the door after painting with interior paint. Notice the discoloration and bad spots. And the pups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/frontdoor/0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I bought the house, the door was pink/mauve. This is a picture from when I bought the house, the only picture I have of the front door. We originally redid it with new paint, weatherstripping, and hardware, but then had to repaint for good. That interior paint was not going to last on the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/frontdoor/before.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We re-did the whole thing - took the door off the hinges, took off the hardware, sanded, sanded, sanded. You can see all of the different layers: wood, pink/mauve from before, primer, and the interior Swimming paint. We took off different levels in different spots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/frontdoor/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/frontdoor/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/frontdoor/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then applied 4 coats of EXTERIOR Swimming - same color, but better for outdoor use. It’ll hold up much better this time. It looks much lighter with the direct light in the garage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ingredients&quot;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 stick butter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/2 cup Keto confectioners sugar, I use Swerve&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/2 tsp salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/2 tsp vanilla extract&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 cups almond flour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/2 cup Dark chocolate chips (or more), I use Hershey’s Dark Chocolate Morsels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;instructions&quot;&gt;Instructions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get your butter to room temperature. I microwave it for 5 seconds on each side.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put butter in a stand mixer and beat.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While still beating, add confectioners sugar, salt, and vanilla extract.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While still beating, add in almond flour, 1/2 cup at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While still beating, add in dark chocolate chips.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Roll into balls and refrigerate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;considerations&quot;&gt;Considerations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do NOT use Coconut Flour. I tried using 1 for 1 coconut flour instead of almond flour, it was like eating a desert. Not a typo. A desert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

When you go to a website, it’ll pop up if you can buy things and get cash back. You simply click “Activate X% Cash Back”, and you earn money in your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebates.com/r/ROBERT47769?eeid=28187&quot;&gt;Ebates&lt;/a&gt; account. The amount of cash back per store varies. After you earn $25, they direct deposit your money to your Paypal, or send you a “Big Fat Check”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ebates/udemy.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ebates&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last 1.5 years or so of using this browser extension, I’ve earned $226.70. Yeah. The main cash back has come from home improvement websites like Lowe’s and Home Depot, where I order online and pick up in store, or get items delivered if they’re big, like a vanity. Note that Home Depot no longer participates in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebates.com/r/ROBERT47769?eeid=28187&quot;&gt;Ebates&lt;/a&gt;, but they usually still have lower prices than Lowes in my area.  I have also earned a few bucks back from Udemy, where I buy training in order to get better at &lt;a href=&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/robertjskelton&quot;&gt;my job&lt;/a&gt;. I highly recommend the Acloudguru courses on Udemy if you work in any type of Cloud Architecture role. I even earned some cash back on buying my &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/optimize-everything/&quot;&gt;Chinese Roomba&lt;/a&gt; and on purchasing a refund from TaxAct!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ebates/ebates.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ebates&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d highly recommend signing up for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebates.com/r/ROBERT47769?eeid=28187&quot;&gt;Ebates&lt;/a&gt; if you do much online shopping, it’ll save you a bit more money, plus you can keep your Ebates cash along with your credit card cash back!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I started using Ebates in February 2017, when I really started putting lots of money into renovating my house.

The vanity I installed does not have the lever to pull up and down the stopper in the drain, so this style is a functional way to have working stoppers. Previously, I had normal drains, and I could not put the stopper down. They were attempted to be pushed down by a few guests, and eventually broke, so I decided to finally replace them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/drains/before.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drains&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I took the old drains out and cleaned the sink bottom, where the new drains would be installed. A lesson learned here is to clean the opening more than you think you should. It took me about 5 installs to get both drains working with no leaks, and each time I found more and more gunk to be cleaned. I’d recommend using an old, heavy towel or t-shirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/drains/drain_removed.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drains&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/drains/bottom_removed.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drains&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The install process of the new drain was pretty simple, I would recommend using &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2O3S4M8&quot;&gt;plumbers tape&lt;/a&gt;. I didn’t do this the first few attempts, and it lead to leaking. The new stopper works by pressing down on the top, and it latches closed. To open, just tap again.&lt;/p&gt;

I first heard of this from &lt;a href=&quot;https://retireby40.org/your-lifetime-wealth-ratio/&quot;&gt;Retire By 40&lt;/a&gt;, which he calls your Lifetime Wealth Ratio. Basically, it’s a way to how well you are investing, or if you’re overspending. I decided to run mine and see!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;social-security-earnings&quot;&gt;Social Security Earnings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get your social security earnings from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ssa.gov/&quot;&gt;Social Security website&lt;/a&gt;, which I signed up for a few years ago, and my figures are below. Note that I worked at a water treatment plant making $8/hr in the summers of 2008, 2009, and 2010. In 2011, 2012 and 2013 I worked 3-5 months per year at an engineering co-op, earning $15.50-$18/hr. I didn’t work in 2014 (still in college), then started my first professional job in May 2015. I switched jobs for a 35% raise in February 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ss/ss_income.png&quot; alt=&quot;Social Security&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So 2008 to 2017, I made $209,044. Added in with my latest paycheck (August 2018), I’ve made $48,305 this year. This brings my lifetime total to $257,349.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;current-net-worth&quot;&gt;Current Net Worth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ss/pc.png&quot; alt=&quot;Networth&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current net worth is $254,500 (tracked with &lt;a href=&quot;http://share.personalcapital.com/x/psOnBl&quot;&gt;Personal Capital&lt;/a&gt;), which means I’m $2,805 BEHIND my Social Security reported income. However, I’m at a &lt;strong&gt;98.9% ratio of net worth to lifetime income&lt;/strong&gt;, which is pretty good at age 26.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how&quot;&gt;How?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason my ratio is this high is because of my great single real estate purchase. I purchased a 4 bedroom single family home in May 2016 for $170K, which is my primary residence. I’ve had 2-3 roommates for the last few years which almost cover my mortgage, which was a 15 year mortgage with 20% down. The house has also appreciated to about $250K, thanks to a strong market and lots of sweat equity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d also like to acknowledge how my family has helped. My dad gave me $5K to help on the down payment on my house, and loaned me $30K to pay back as I could. I paid it back in less than 6 months after &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/drive-cool-cars-on-a-budget/&quot;&gt;downgrading my car&lt;/a&gt; and putting every penny towards it. I also recently received a $25K life insurance check from my grandfather passing. 100% of that was put into investments and savings. Both of these benefits gave me a head start, and its something I’m very thankful for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m doing pretty well at &lt;strong&gt;98.9%&lt;/strong&gt; of my lifetime earnings still attributed to me in assets, investments, or cash.

&lt;p&gt;In the last year, I’ve helped my fiancé raise her credit score from ~580 to ~720, and my credit score is over 800. Credit scores are a number that lenders take into account when offering you loans, and can make a huge difference when buying a house. A high credit score will get you a lower interest rate, which can add up to tens of thousands of dollars over the life of a mortgage. It takes time to increase your credit score, but it is very simple to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit scores take into account many things, but one of the most important and easiest to change is credit utilization, which is how much you’ve spent vs how much you have available. The goal is to decrease the amount you owe, and increase the amount you can borrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Sign up for a credit monitoring service.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.creditkarma.com&quot;&gt;CreditKarma&lt;/a&gt; since it is 100% free and updates every two weeks. Lots of credit cards will provide credit scores and monitoring as well, but I still use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.creditkarma.com&quot;&gt;CreditKarma&lt;/a&gt;. The goal is to see what lines of credit you have open, and things you can do to improve your credit score. When checking my fiancé’s, we found out she was an Authorized User on one of her parents cards with high utilization. We got her parents to remove her from that, which helped decrease the overall utilization of her lines of credit, which helped increase her credit score. You might find something on your credit report you did not know about!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/credit/score.png&quot; alt=&quot;Score&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Start getting Credit Cards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re just starting out with credit, you’ll want no annual fee, easy to obtain credit cards. The first three credit cards my fiancé got were no annual fee, easy to get, simple rewards, and we applied for them about 3-4 months apart. These 3 cards are considered some of the best beginning cards. When you get your card, setup auto-pay and link them into your &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/personal-capital-review/&quot;&gt;Personal Capital&lt;/a&gt; account, which is also highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

My fiancé got a $1,200 line of credit on this one, her second card, so now she had $2,700 of total credit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://refer.discover.com/s/zmk6g&quot;&gt;Discover IT&lt;/a&gt; - $50 sign on bonus, 1% back on all purchases and 5% on rotating categories, just like the Chase Freedom, HOWEVER! Your first year, Discover matches all your cash back, which effectively makes this a 2% everything, 10% rotating categories card for 1 year. My fiancé got a $5,500 line of credit on this one, her third card, so now she has $8,200 of total credit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that her total credit available is increasing substantially, but her spending stays about the same. If she spent $1,000/mo, with her only 1 credit card, she is using $1,000 / $1,500, or ~67% of her total credit. Now that she has 3 cards and more available credit, her new credit utilization is $1,000 / $8,200, or just 12% of her credit. It’s best to keep this number as low as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Other Things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep your Cards Open&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should always keep your no-annual fee credit cards open, even if you stop using them, since it will increase the average credit line age. One of my favorite cards, the Sallie Mae Barclaycard, removed the majority of good cash back benefits from the card. I still have the card open, but haven’t spent a penny on it since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be reasonable when applying for new cards.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t apply for credit cards you don’t think you’ll get approved for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep Tabs on Your Spending&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always track your cards, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/personal-capital-review/&quot;&gt;Personal Capital&lt;/a&gt; or in Mint. You can see some of my cards and their credit limits below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/credit/pc.png&quot; alt=&quot;Credit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bills in Your Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other things you can do to increase your credit is to have utility bills in your name, so if you’re renting a house, put the utilities in your name. Always set up auto-pay to make sure your bills are paid in full, every month. Months and years of no missed payments will help your credit as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you start getting into the world of Annual Fee cards and churning, this guide might not be for you. :) For further reading see, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/churning&quot;&gt;/r/churning&lt;/a&gt;, this is for those who don’t mind juggling 20+ cards to gain tons of airline miles and points, not for the faint of heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These simple steps will help get your credit score up and will save you money when applying for loans that matter, such as car and home loans. My 800+ credit score helped me secure a low mortgage rate (3.25%) and a low car loan rate (1.49%). A high credit score will save you money over time, and is simple to get high and keep high.&lt;/p&gt;

His name is Bentley, and he’s a wonderful dog! He weighs about 65 pounds, and stays with me while I work from home. I wanted to know exactly how much he was costing us, so here’s the expenses for our dog broken down. This post is also an excuse to publish tons of dog pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dog/pup.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bentley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purchase/Adoption&lt;/strong&gt; - If you buy a dog from a breeder, costs can be in the multi-hundreds to the multi-thousands of dollars. We adopted our pup at the Humane Society, and the adoption fee was $120. He was already neutered, had his first few rounds of shots, and was already healthy enough to be taken home at 8 weeks. I’m not going to include this one time cost in my yearly dog expenses, but it’s something to consider with a dog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dog/cake.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bentley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training&lt;/strong&gt; - We did a Beginning Puppy Training at PetCo, it was a little over $100. This class was really more about us (the humans) learning how to train our dog. Now that we have taken it, I think we’d do a good job at training any other dogs we adopt without paying for a class. This was also a one time expense, so I won’t count it towards yearly expenses. I highly recommend taking a class like this with your first dog so that you can learn how to train them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dog/lake.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bentley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2trGgLe&quot;&gt;Food&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - We buy a bag of dog food about every 5 weeks, about 10 bags per year. We buy &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2trGgLe&quot;&gt;Hills Science Diet for Sensitive Stomachs&lt;/a&gt;, highly recommended by every vet Elizabeth has ever worked for. Each bag costs about $50. We also give him lots of veggies, peanut butter, and table scraps, but they aren’t just for him. He gets all of the broccoli stalks and lots of baby carrots, those costs are more associated with us humans though, so counting those here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dog/barkbox.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bentley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barkbox.com/r/VLSI3YAX94&quot;&gt;BarkBox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -  We use BarkBox to get new toys and treats, but mostly to keep up out of the Pet Store. We’re pretty bad about impulse buying all kinds of treats and bones when we’re in there. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barkbox.com/r/VLSI3YAX94&quot;&gt;BarkBox&lt;/a&gt; costs $20/month, and has been very worth it for us so far. It usually has 2 toys, 2 bags of treats, and a bone, which would cost well over $20 at PetCo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dog/tango.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bentley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2MprawH&quot;&gt;Probiotic Powder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Bentley farts a lot. We give him 1 probiotic powder pack at breakfast to reduce that as much as possible, this is about $1 per day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dog/pool.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bentley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medicine&lt;/strong&gt; - Here’s where we have gotten lucky so far. My fiancé, Elizabeth, works for a veterinarian’s office. So far, we have received all of Bentley’s medicine for free! This saves us about $200 per year, so if your fiancé doesn’t work for a vet, don’t forget to consider for this cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dog/halloween.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bentley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vet Visits&lt;/strong&gt; - Required shots, yearly checkups, etc. Bentley has had issues with his stomach, so we’ve had a few costly vet visits already. It does help that Elizabeth gets all vet services for half price because of her job, so we’ve spent about $400 per year so far on this. It’d be more than double if we didn’t have that benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dog/luau.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bentley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;www.rover.com/refer/robers32904/&quot;&gt;Dog Sitting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - I stay at home with Bentley most days, and if I’m out of town then my fiancé or our roommates usually feed him, take him outside to use the bathroom, etc. The exception is long holidays when everyone goes out of town, like Thanksgiving or Christmas. We paid our neighbor $100 last year to watch Bentley for a few days over Christmas, and Elizabeth stayed in town on Thanksgiving. This year we’ll probably both be gone both holidays, so maybe $200 for dog sitting those two holidays. We’ve used &lt;a href=&quot;www.rover.com/refer/robers32904/&quot;&gt;Rover&lt;/a&gt; to watch other dogs before, and will likely look to utilize it again over the holidays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dog/lightsaber.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bentley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other&lt;/strong&gt; - I say we have the BarkBox to keep up out of the pet store, but we still go too much. I’d say on average, we spend $20/month on more toys, leashes, collars, &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2K9EhWo&quot;&gt;harnesses&lt;/a&gt;, dog bowls, treats, bones, a cage, dog bed, etc. We bought most of this stuff when we first got Bentley, but we still buy him new collars, more bones, and harnesses and leashes if the old ones get worn out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dog/hd.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bentley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total = Food + BarkBox + Probiotic Powder + Medicine + Vet Visits + Dog Sitting + Etc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total = (10 bags * $50) + (12 months * $20/month) + (365 days * $1/day) + $0 + ($400/yr) + ($200/year)+ (12 months * $20/month)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total per Year = ($500) + ($240) + ($365) + ($0) + ($400) + ($200) + ($240)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total = $1,945&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dog/handsome.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bentley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you go, about $2,000 per year for our full size Labrador, or $5.50 per day. So worth it. This does not factor in some large upfront costs, like adoption fees, puppy training, or some things you’ll need for your first dog, like harnesses, leashes, crates, dog beds, which will likely add up to over $500. Getting a dog is a big financial decision, but can be even more expensive if you have to take your dog to day care or don’t have access to benefits of a vet office.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">My fiancé, Elizabeth, and I adopted a black lab mix puppy from the Lee County Humane Society in Auburn, AL in April 2017.
