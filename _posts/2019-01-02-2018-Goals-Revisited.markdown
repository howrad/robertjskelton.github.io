I keep track of some short term and long term goals using checklists in Google Keep. Here is a recap of my goals for 2018.

### Financial
* Max out my Roth IRA ($5.5k)- PASS
* Max out my fianc√©s Roth IRA ($5.5k)- FAIL, we set up an auto-contribution, but ended up about 1k short. We still have until April to finish this goal, which we will.
* Max out my 401k ($18.5k)- PASS, or really close.
* Max out my HSA ($3.45k)- PASS
* Keep 3k in an Ally Emergency Fund - FAIL, I had 3k in there multiple times but I always take it out. I use my emergency fund different than most.
* Have 30k saved in taxable investment accounts for a down payment on our next house - FAIL, reached 19k.
* Reach a Net Worth of 260k - FAIL. I hit 259.5k in June! The market fluctuated so much that I ended the year with about 255k.
* Have a total of 100k invested - PASS

### House
* [Fix Pool Cage](https://rskelton.com/pool-enclosure-replacement/) - PASS
* Redo Owen's Room - PASS. One of my roommates finally moved out, so we redid that room. It was pretty disgusting. About $600 in materials and some sweat and it looks amazing.
* Redo the kitchen - FAIL, this one is going to be expensive and I hope to get it done by the end of 2019. I did buy a much needed new fridge!
* Finish master bathroom - PASS. We installed new floors, vanity, tub, toilet, shower, etc. It's nice.
* Finish master closet - FAIL. The layout of the small master closet kinda stinks, so I want to redo the shelving.
* [Finish 2nd bathroom](https://rskelton.com/$500-bathroom-remodel/) - FAIL. We painted the cabinets and walls and put in a new mirror and fixtures, but have yet to do the floors or shower. That is a priority in 2019.
* Paint outside of house - FAIL. I got lots of free exterior paint but never got the drive to actually complete this.
* Landscaping - FAIL. I put in some fruit trees and a lavender garden, but I need to put in tons more work outside.

### Education
* A in Educational Technology in Spring 2018 at Georgia Tech - PASS
* A in Machine Learning for Trading in Summer 2018 at Georgia Tech - FAIL, I dropped the summer course because of the rigor.
* A in Health Informations in Fall 2018 at Georgia Tech - FAIL, I got a B. I'll take it.
* Get Elizabeth and my college diplomas framed - FAIL. It would take me an hour at Michaels and a few hundred bucks, but I haven't done it still.
* Obtain the AWS SysOps Administrator Certification - PASS.

### Other
* Weight down to 200 - PASS, we started on the keto diet and I dropped from 220 to 195.
* Reach 125 of the [Top 250 Beers on Beer Advocate](https://www.beeradvocate.com/lists/top/) - FAIL, I was at 102 at the start of the year, and they changed their algorithm. I ended up with about 90.
* Go to church - FAIL, we went 3 or 4 times.
* Get engaged - PASS
* Get a newer car - PASS...twice. I bought a 2016 Corvette and a 2007 Lexus GX470.
