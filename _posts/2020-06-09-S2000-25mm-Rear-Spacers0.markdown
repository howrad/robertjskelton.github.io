I bought a 1991 Suzuki Cappuccino, more on that later. First thing to do was an oil change. This is following [Larry's Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M3r7QcHHKA)

### Parts Required
* Oil Filter - I used a Fram FS4386. You can also use a [Fram FG4967](https://amzn.to/2W5Qmje) or [Baldwin B33](https://amzn.to/3292e7S), or others.
* Oil - about 3 quarts, I used [Mobil 1 5W-30](https://amzn.to/328lP8o).
* 17mm wrench
* [Oil filter removal tool](https://amzn.to/3276yEI)
* Drain pan
* Funnel
* Gloves, you definitely want to wear these
* Paper towels or shop towels to clean up

1. Drive car on ramps or lift the front end.

2. Remove oil cap in the engine
3. Remove oil filter
4. Remove drain plug with 17mm, rotating clockwise!
5. Oh yeah, make sure you have a drain pan under the car. Let the oil drain for a while.

6. Add in the drain plug with a little bit of old oil, tighten just a bit with your 17mm.
7. Add in your oil filter, just hand tight is fine.

8. Add about 3 quarts of oil
9. Replace oil cap
10. Drive car off ramps, let sit at idle for about 5 minutes and watch for any leaks.
11. If no leaks, check the oil level using the dipstick. If it is between full and low, you're done. If low, add more oil. If too full, that stinks. Repeat steps 1-10.
