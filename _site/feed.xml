It’s been written about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/&quot;&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://20somethingfinance.com/personal-savings-rate/&quot;&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; again, and everyone has a different thought on it.
I had never sat down and calculated mine, so here goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My money is moving to multiple different investment accounts. I have my Fidelity 401k through work, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.madfientist.com/ultimate-retirement-account/&quot;&gt;Optum HSA (Health Savings Account)&lt;/a&gt; through work, a Vanguard Roth IRA that is contributed to post-tax, I buy individual stocks through &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/robinhood/&quot;&gt;Robinhood&lt;/a&gt;, and a Vanguard taxable brokerage account that I put money in to save for a down payment on my next house. My income from work is $82,400 pre-tax, and is used for Savings Rate Calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note that these calculations do not include stock dividends, rent that my roommates provide to go towards my mortgage, or equity in my mortgage. This is my interpretation of a Savings Rate calculation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-savings-rate-calculation&quot;&gt;My Savings Rate Calculation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fidelity 401k&lt;/strong&gt; - I contribute 22% of my pay (as close to $18,500 as possible) and my employer contributes 7% = 29% * $82,400 = $23,896&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optum HSA&lt;/strong&gt; - I contribute the maximum allowed = $3,450/yr&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vanguard Roth IRA&lt;/strong&gt; - I contribute the maximum allowed, as I have extra money throughout the year = $5,500/yr&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vanguard Taxable Brokerage&lt;/strong&gt; - I add $50 week = $50 * 52 = $2,600/yr&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/robinhood/&quot;&gt;Robinhood Individual Stocks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - I stopped with automatic contributions here, I still add about $100/mo = $100 * 12 = $1,200/yr
Total Invested Per Year = $36,646
Divided by Salary = $36,646 / $82,400 = 44.5%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you have it, almost a 45% savings rate. Considering the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT&quot;&gt;average savings rate&lt;/a&gt; in America was 3.1% at the time of writing, I think I’m saving pretty well. It is difficult when checking the pay stub from work, seeing your income, but then seeing almost half of your income directed to other accounts you can’t spend. I’m glad I got into the habit of not taking my entire paycheck to a bank account!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Savings rate is always talked about in the Financial Independence / Early Retirement (FI/RE) space.

They cost $43 and a few hours of my time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bookshelves/pre.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bookshelves&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Materials included brackets and a piece of 3/4” MDF, cut down to 2 pieces of 9” x 24”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bookshelves/paint.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bookshelves&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were then sanded, given 2 coats of primer, then a final coat of Behr white paint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bookshelves/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bookshelves&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure to use a level on your brackets, both vertically and horizontally. I used a large textbook to guess how far apart the shelves should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bookshelves/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bookshelves&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lumber was $13, the 4 brackets were $30, and I already owned the paint and brushes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bookshelves/attached.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bookshelves&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the final product with some books! Total of $43 and about 2 hours of time.&lt;/p&gt;

Great gas mileage, easy to drive, hardly any issues in almost 60,000 miles! The window regulator broke on the passenger side, which was fixed at the dealer for $300, just out of warranty. The steering wheel column cover also broke, and the dealer wanted $600 to fix that, so I decided to see what I could do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fiat/removed.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fiat&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steering column cover is 2 pieces of plastic that sit around the steering column, and has openings for the ignition, wiper stalk, and turn signal stalk. The bottom plastic piece is attached to the column by 2 short screws (shown above), which sit on small plastic spacer sections of the lower piece. These plastic pieces are fragile, and broke about a year ago. This means the 2 pieces of plastic are just flapping around while driving, not secured to anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fiat/halfoff.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fiat&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took the entire assembly off, found 2 longer screws and washers that would secure the plastic bottom piece to the steering column. I attached both and tightened them up, but found that it made the ignition hard to use, and the turn signal stalk was obstructed. It was secured too tight. I ended up removed 1 of the screw and washer sets, so that just 1 remains, and it is as secure as it was when new, but it won’t break this time!&lt;/p&gt;

These enclosures are common to have over Florida pools to keep leaves and bugs out. Some people call them screen, cages, bird cages, enclosures, etc. I had a few screen panels blown out in 2016 during Hurricane Matthew, and the guy who replaced them said I’d be lucky if my enclosure lasted 5 more years. It lasted 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My old pool enclosure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pool/before_irma.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Irma destoryed that enclosure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pool/irma.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hurricane Irma destroyed my original enclosure in September 2017. I got 4 quotes to replace the enclosure, along with a few screen on my front porch. I finally got an insurance check for about $9,000 in January 2018, and then got 4 quotes. The quotes were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$14,242 with a 6 month lead time. 100% down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$11,940 with a 4 month lead time. 10% down, 90% due at completion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$9,985 with a 4 month lead time. 60% down, 40% due at completion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$10,685 with a 3 month lead time. 0% down, 100% due at completion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went with the 4th company, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.palmbayaluminum.com&quot;&gt;Palm Bay Aluminum&lt;/a&gt;, even though they weren’t the cheapest. The cheapest required 60% of the cost up front, but Palm Bay Aluminum asked for 0% down and 100% at completion. Leaving my money invested for those 4 months earned me about $200 interest anyways, so the price difference was about $500 after factoring that in. Not having to carry the risk of some aluminum company having lots of my money before even starting a project was worth it for me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My screen was started on April 17 and took about 4 days to finish the install. The front screens were completed shortly after, and the permit signed off and inspected on May 4, 2018. Until the screen was started, I had this chicken wire fence around the pool, to keep the dogs in and because it is a law to have some sort of fence around your pool. It looked terrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pool/before.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palm Bay Aluminum started by removing the old gutter and prepping the existing metal roof area for attachments. They ended up adding a 3” beam of aluminum for better structural integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pool/prep.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s all the aluminum and parts they needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pool/materials.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the new “super gutter” installed. The old gutter only went the length of the roof on the house, and didn’t have a gutter attached to the metal roof area above the Florida room (where you can see the step). The new super gutter runs the entire length, which is stronger, better for water flow, and looks way better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pool/gutter.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I thought was interesting is that the assemblers build the entire roof in the front yard in pieces, then walk it to the back and and raise it, then place a wall under it. The roof is screened before being raised into place. It makes a ton of sense! The new roof is a Mansard style, which is stronger than the box gable style that the old screen was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pool/front_yard_assembly.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screen&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pool/front_yard_assembly_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screen&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pool/raising.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screen&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pool/up.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got them to install a dog door for Bentley, and it is super sturdy. It’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2L54qCF&quot;&gt;Magnador&lt;/a&gt;, which is framed in with aluminum. It has magnets on the bottom and flap in order to keep the flap at its lowest position. It also has locks so that you can lock the dog in or out, or if you don’t have a dog you can lock it to ensure no other creatures figure out the door. I got the biggest size possible, since Bentley is a pretty big dog at 65 pounds. The additional cost to install and frame the dog door in was $125, on top of the previously stated prices above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pool/side.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screen&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pool/far_side.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screen&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pool/bentley.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screen&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pool/dog_door.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoying one of my favorite beers the first day with a screen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pool/huna.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how they joined the super gutter into the existing downspout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pool/gutter_attached.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the screen was up, Alex and I (but mostly Alex) got to work installing lighting. There were awesome string lights in a zig-zag pattern on the old enclosure which were hooked up to an on/off switch, we wanted that same functionality, but better. Alex hooked up a system with pulleys that required attaching hooks at the top most point and a lower point on each side, so we needed to get up there. He made a ladder thing that went across the pool so you could reach the top with a 10 ft ladder. Check it out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pool/ladder.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screen&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pool/alex.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bentley also found a new way to sit, with his tail just hanging into the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pool/bentley_sitting.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as the electrical, each beam of the roof has its own outlet, which is run through black conduit. So there are 5 outlets for the 5 strands of lights, and the strands can be pulled in and out easily as they are on wire. The lights are just in a staggered pattern now, no zig-zags like before. I think I’ll replace the light strands with Christmas lights in December!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pool/electrical_in_progress.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screen&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pool/electrical_in_progress_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screen&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pool/electrical.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grey switch is the on/off switch for the lights, and it turns on all 5 sets of lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pool/lights_off.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the enclosure opposite mine is a box gable roof, like my old one was. It looks like a triangle at the end. The new style is different, more squared. The result is a higher maximum roof height!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pool/lights_on.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very pleased with the new enclosure, the lights, the dog door, and Alex and Palm Bay Aluminum’s work!&lt;/p&gt;

I kept the existing vanity and shower, but gave everything a nice touchup. The changes included new paint on the walls and vanity cabinets, new towel and toilet paper holders, new mirror, new vanity light, new baseboards, and a new curved shower rod curtain. Both the shower rod curtain and vanity light are the same model as in the master bathroom we remodeled recently. I kept the existing over the toilet wall mounted storage, since it’s in good shape. Here are the before pictures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/before1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/before2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/before3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/before4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vanity top was pretty nice, but the cabinets were yellow (WHY) and the hardware was bad. I took the vanity doors and hardware off, and painted everything with 2 coats of primer (Kilz) and 2 coats of a white finish coat (Behr). I bought new hinges and handles to finish it off, along with lots of caulk and wood fill to mask the previous imperfections in the cabinets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/cabinets1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cabinets&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/cabinets2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cabinets&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/cabinets3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cabinets&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/cabinets4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cabinets&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before painting, I took off the old school toothbrush holder, toilet paper holder and towel holder. They were plastered in, so I did as good a job as I can with re-drywalling and patching. We bought 1 gallon of a green paint, and didn’t even use half of it.  Cindy was a huge help with the painting. Notice the blue outlines on the mirror - that’s the size of the new medicine cabinet mirror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/process1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Process&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/process2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Process&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/process3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Process&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/process4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Process&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were also 2 hooks on the ceiling, maybe for hanging plants? They were above the old vanity light. I took the hooks down and plastered and painted over them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/process5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Process&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/process6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Process&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/process7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Process&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we painted before installing the new vanity light, it was dark in the bathroom. There are no windows! We used a work lamp to paint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/process8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Process&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/process9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Process&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/process10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Process&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/process11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Process&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/process12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Process&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/process13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Process&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/process14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Process&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bathroom doesn’t have pull out drawers in the vanity, they’re blanks, so there isn’t much storage. I decided to buy the biggest medicine cabinet I could find, which was 48” x 30”. It’s almost as big as the old mirror was. This gives more storage and a more modern look. A new vanity light helped as well. I installed a dual curved shower curtain holder, so you can hang towels on the outside and people can still shower. The toilet paper holder has a storage spot on top for baby wipes. Alex was helpful in installing all the new wall hanging hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/shower.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Done&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old shower tile doesn’t match great with the new bathroom, but it’ll get retiled…eventually… This is nice for now. There’s enough storage for my roommates to keep their stuff off of the vanity so that guests can have a nicer bathroom, and the room seems so much bigger now that it’s actually nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/final1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Done&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/final2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Done&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bathroom/final3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Done&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the costs, I bought most of the smaller items off Amazon, the Mirrored Medicine Cabinet was bought in person from Home Depot, and the Vanity Light was bought online from Lowe’s with a coupon. I already had the primer and white paint, tools, paintbrushes, drywall, etc. Here’s the breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was under $500, sweet! As a bonus, here’s a picture of a 48” x 30” mirrored medicine cabinet in the back of the Corvette. The guy at Home Depot who helped me load it in was skeptical, but this car is as practical as any truck.&lt;/p&gt;

I kept the existing vanity and shower, but gave everything a nice touchup. The changes included new paint on the walls and vanity cabinets, new towel and toilet paper holders, new mirror, new vanity light, new baseboards, and a new curved shower rod curtain. Both the shower rod curtain and vanity light are the same model as in the master bathroom we remodeled recently. I kept the existing over the toilet wall mounted storage, since it’s in good shape.

Some Corvette owners make fun of it, saying it looks like braces or orthodontics. I kinda agree, it doesn’t look great. I could’ve bought the Z06 grill insert, which is about $200 and looks better, or a homemade method to remove the chrome – electrical tape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/braces/before.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice there is a single chrome strip through the middle of the grill, with a small split in the middle. I took some simple black electrical tape and stretched it to cover one half, then pressed firmly to let it adhere. I used an X-Acto knife to cut around the thinner part near the middle, shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/braces/xacto.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;X-Acto Knifing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then repeat for the other half, and put a small section of electrical tape over the center gap, so that you can’t see any chrome. See the results below! I think it’s a huge improvement, and I can always switch back to chrome if I change my mind!&lt;/p&gt;

Most people utilize a basic checking account which earns little to no interest. In fact, most big name national banks only give .01% interest! I use a little known credit union in Illinois, even though I live in Florida and have never visited the bank in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The credit union is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.myconsumers.org/personal/checking&quot;&gt;Consumers Credit Union (CCU)&lt;/a&gt;. They have a high interest checking account that gives 3.09% interest on up to $10,000 and no ATM fees. There are a few hoops you have to jump through to get that high interest rate, which are easy to manage and VERY worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get one direct deposit per month. Easy, just setup some or all of your workplace paycheck to use this bank. The majority of my paycheck goes here every other week.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Access online banking once per month. This is easily accomplished using finance aggregation websites, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/personal-capital-review&quot;&gt;Personal Capital&lt;/a&gt; or Mint. I prefer &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/personal-capital-review&quot;&gt;Personal Capital&lt;/a&gt; for wealth management, but I think Mint is better for budgeting. I used Mint throughout college to get a better grasp on finances, though I made the switch to &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/personal-capital-review&quot;&gt;Personal Capital&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 when I discovered Mint couldn’t track my mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You also need to elect to receive eDocuments. Sure, easy, no one wants more snail mail.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, complete 12 pin-less debit transactions. This is the only one that requires effort. For this, both my brother and I have our CCU debit card linked to Facebook Messenger. Every month, we send each other 12 individual one cent transactions. Each one registers as a pin-less debit card transactions, and our obligations are met!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This yields me about $30-50 per month just off of my money I have in a holding pattern, waiting to pay off my utility bills, credit cards, and mortgage. There are a few small tasks you have to setup to take advantage of the higher interest rates, but are well worth checking out. If you don’t meet all of the above, you still earn .01%, which is normal for big banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ccu/interest.png&quot; alt=&quot;Interest&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;higher-interest-accounts&quot;&gt;Higher Interest Accounts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They even have a few tiers of higher interest checking accounts available, but those require you to use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.myconsumers.org/credit-cards/visa-cards/visa-signature-cash-rebate-card&quot;&gt;CCU Visa Signature Cash credit card&lt;/a&gt;. If you get their credit card and spend $500/mo on it, you earn 4.09% interest on up to a 15k balance. If you spend $1,000/mo on their credit card, you earn 4.59% interest on up to a 20k balance. I’ve been using the credit card for a few months, and usually spend a little over $1,000 on it to get the best interest rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ccu/rewards.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rewards&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;credit-card&quot;&gt;Credit Card&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CCU credit card also offers 3% back on grocery stores, 2% on gas, and 1% on everything else. My favorite thing about this credit card is that all rewards accumulated over the month are automatically applied to your statement. Unlike Discover, Chase, Amex, etc, you don’t have to manually login to redeem rewards in $25 increments! It requires a hard pull on your credit, but has been very worth it for me so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;loans&quot;&gt;Loans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also use a car loan through Consumers Credit Union, which I talked more about in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/rent-other-peoples-cars-with-turo/&quot;&gt;Turo Review.&lt;/a&gt; I took a ~$37,000 used car loan for 48 months at 1.49% interest, which is REALLY low for a used car. These payments come out every 2 weeks from my checking account. Notice you can also check your CCU credit card statements from the loan section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ccu/loans.png&quot; alt=&quot;Loans&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;downsides&quot;&gt;Downsides&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found a few downsides for using Consumers Credit Union. Checks cost money, which I think is normal now, and also I can’t deposit cash. The CCU app lets your deposit checks using pictures, like most major banks, but there is no way to deposit cash when you live in Florida and all the physical locations are in Illinois. I have a local credit union that I deposit my cash into, but I don’t keep much money there since the interest rate is only .01%. If you don’t want to jump through a few hoops, you can earn over 1.5% at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ally.com&quot;&gt;Ally Bank&lt;/a&gt;, which I recommend as a good place for your emergency fund!&lt;/p&gt;

I’m over-invested in one place right now, and it’s my own employer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;current&quot;&gt;Current&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started working at General Electric (GE) a little over a year ago. I wanted to have stock in my company, so I started buying GE shares on &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/robinhood&quot;&gt;Robinhood&lt;/a&gt;. As you might have seen, GE stock is doing terribly, and I’ve lost over $1,000 on my shares so far. My first share was bought for $32. Shares dropped into the $12 range recently. I also put a 5% of my 401k contributions into a GE stock fund. That small portion of my contribution is down over 30%! And to make my reliance on the General even worse, GE pays my paycheck. GE is not doing so hot right now, with occasional layoffs, selling businesses, cost cutting methods, reduced travel, etc. My division,  GE Transportation, is for sale, though we’re doing pretty well. I got my first bonus this year, and a better raise than I ever got at previous employers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;looking-ahead&quot;&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though my division is in talks of being sold, I will likely retain my job since I’m good at it, it saves the company a ton of money, and do it for a low price compared to others with the same skills. However, in the next few years, my paycheck will likely not come from GE. Instead, it will come from whatever company purchases the Transportation division. I think that GE stock will be a great long term investment. I won’t sell my shares for many, many years, and they will continue to pay dividends, even though there was a recent major dividend slash. GE stock is at a great price right now, and I’m happy to be buying more shares and accumulating them in my 401k as well. The upside is a few years out, but I’ll be patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, just a small word of advice on not to get too invested in the success of your employer! Do as I say, not as I do.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This is just a friendly word of caution about putting all of your eggs in one basket.

Unfortunately, &lt;a href=&quot;http://share.robinhood.com/roberts459&quot;&gt;Robinhood&lt;/a&gt; does not link with &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/personal-capital-review&quot;&gt;Personal Capital&lt;/a&gt;, but you can add your shares manually. They’ve lowered the barrier to entry when buying individual securities. It used to be that you’d pay $7+ per trade, so you’d only buy $1,000 or more of stocks at a time. Now, you can buy stocks with no fees!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/robinhood/pc.png&quot; alt=&quot;Robinhood on Personal Capital&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got over $3,600 in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://share.robinhood.com/roberts459&quot;&gt;Robinhood&lt;/a&gt; account, and until recently was putting more money in every week. Now, I just re-invest my dividends and put more towards my taxable brokerage account in Vanguard. Most of my shares are in Orchid Island Capital (ORC) and General Electric (GE). ORC is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) which gives monthly dividends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/robinhood/dividends.png&quot; alt=&quot;My Recent Dividends&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both ORC and GE have done pretty terrible since I’ve bought them, and both have cut their dividends pretty significantly. I’ve lost a large chunk of money on GE, which is in its worst period ever. I work at GE, and I don’t think it’ll be this cheap forever, so I’m banking on a large return at some point in my lifetime - I’m in no hurry to sell. My main goal is to receive dividends from all my my stocks. I earn about $300/yr in dividends right now, and that’s only going up. At some point, dividends will be a larger part of my total income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/robinhood/ios.png&quot; alt=&quot;Robinhood iOS Application&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to try it out, use my &lt;a href=&quot;http://share.robinhood.com/roberts459&quot;&gt;referral code&lt;/a&gt;. If you do, you’ll get a free stock, and I’ll get a free share when you buy your first stock. These shares can be worth from $3 to $150. My girlfriend signed up and got a share of HP (HPQ) worth about $19 at the time. Most of the free shares I’ve earned have been worth about $6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/robinhood/web.png&quot; alt=&quot;Robinhood Web Interface&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re trading on &lt;a href=&quot;http://share.robinhood.com/roberts459&quot;&gt;Robinhood&lt;/a&gt;, I highly recommend doing a limit buy or limit sell. This way you specify the most you’d pay for a stock, or the least you’d sell your stock for. Some people put in many limit buys for low prices, and many limit sells for high prices. That way, if a stock happens to get pretty high, it’ll automatically sell. This could be awesome if you’re just trying to flip stocks, but it might go up even higher than your limit sell is set at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://share.robinhood.com/roberts459&quot;&gt;Robinhood&lt;/a&gt; has recently added cryptocurrencies and options to their repertoire of services, though I haven’t delved into either. You can buy and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, along with tons of other crypto, and also buy and sell options of stocks. I don’t quite understand options, other than that you can make or lose a lot of money very quickly. I’ll stick with the tried and true dividend stocks. I have a little bit of crypto, but I bought it before Robinhood released that feature.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I buy stocks for no commissions using Robinhood.

Over the years, it has been hosted at &lt;a href=&quot;https://robertjskelton.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;robertjskelton.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;, robertjskelton.com (dead), and skelton.co (dead). I have hosted it using WordPress on DigitalOcean, Github Pages, a Static AWS S3 bucket, and now this current iteration is my favorite. This site is here to stay, finally. This site also merges content from citrusrenovations.com (defunct home renovation blog) and retirengineering.com (defunct financial blog), both of which I hosted using WordPress on DigitalOcean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I previously set up rskelton.com using a Highly Available (HA) WordPress install on AWS. I use AWS for my job full time, so this was good experience. The problem is, it’s really expensive to have a HA install, $70/mo or more. I didn’t want to pay that much for just a blog, so I set about finding a new way to manage a blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;rskelton.com currently uses the following technologies, and drew inspiration from &lt;a href=&quot;https://hendrixjoseph.github.io&quot;&gt;Joe Hendrix’s Github Page&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, specifically &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jekyllnow.com/&quot;&gt;jekyll-now&lt;/a&gt;. Jekyll is an awesome framework that turns markdown into a website. It takes a little while to get used to it, definitely more complicated than Wordpress, but worth the time to learn it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;Github pages&lt;/a&gt;, which automatically runs and hosts the jekyll markdown code&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Github is where for the code for the site is hosted. It is all open source in my public repo, available &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/robertjskelton/robertjskelton.github.io&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. For new posts, I create a post locally on my laptop. I can use “jekyll serve” to preview changes in a browser at “localhost:4000”, and then push my changes to my repo. After that, they appear on &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com&quot;&gt;rskelton.com&lt;/a&gt; within seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/route53/&quot;&gt;Route 53&lt;/a&gt; in AWS, this is my DNS. I pay a small amount per lookup, less than $1/month.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com&quot;&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt; for SSL. Github pages does SSL if you use their website name (robertjskelton.github.io) but since I used a custom domain, that isn’t supported. Cloudflare provides a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/&quot;&gt;simple way&lt;/a&gt; to fix that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://disqus.com/&quot;&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt; for comments.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://analytics.google.com&quot;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt; for Analytics.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/adsense&quot;&gt;Google Adsense&lt;/a&gt; for ads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also own the following websites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://beertastingbrevard.com&quot;&gt;Beer Tasting Brevard&lt;/a&gt; - a beer tasting company website that I started. It is hosted using a static S3 bucket, AWS Cloudfront for SSL, and Route 53 for DNS. I also have some Javascript on the site that uses Instagram API to pull new images from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/beertastingbrevard&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;. This way, I never have to manually update pictures on the website, new images are automatically populated from Instagram posts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://robertsvalvejrmods.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;Robert’s Epiphone Valve Jr Mods&lt;/a&gt; - Hosted with Blogspot, this was an Electrical Engineering undergrad project, I made a bunch of modifications to a guitar amp and documented them on this site.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://robertandashleightakeeurope.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;Europe Travel Blog&lt;/a&gt; - Hosted with Blogspot, this is a 2013 Europe travel blog. If I hadn’t made these 2 blogs using Blogspot, I’m 100% sure I would have tried to change hosts 10 times and lost all my content over the last 5 years. Blogspot isn’t fancy or pretty, but I’m glad I used it back then.&lt;/li&gt;
