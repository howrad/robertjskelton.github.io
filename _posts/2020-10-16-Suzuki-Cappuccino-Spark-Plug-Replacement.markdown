I replaced the 3 spark plugs on my Cappuccino, pretty easy process. I'd recommend doing just 1 at a time, so that you can't mess up which spark plug wire to use.

### Parts Required
* [Spark Plugs, NGK 6046 DCPR7EIX x3](https://amzn.to/358RJRS)
* [Spark Plug Wires, x3](https://amzn.to/2T228co)
* [5/8" Spark Plug deep socket](https://amzn.to/2H7OIZY)

I had to take off 1 hose above the spark plugs, using needle nose pliers. Mine did not have a cover over the spark plugs, but they came with one stock.

Then just remove the spark plug wire, remove the old spark plug with a 5/8" deep socket, then replace with your new spark plug and give it a half turn to tighten. I bought pre-gapped spark plugs, so no gapping needed. The last spark plug was difficult for me to get out, I ended up having to spray some PB Blaster in there (a common theme with this car...), then let it sit for a bit before removing it. It was way over tightened.

Then just replace your spark plug wires, if you want, 2/3 of mine were in good shape, but I figure I'd go ahead and replace them, they're cheap.
