I fixed the 2 keys for my Lexus. The battery in both keys was dead, so the remote didn't work. The screws to get the battery out were stripped, so I have to destroy each case to get in. [AJT Designs](https://www.ajtdesign-llc.com/online-store/Injection-Fob-2008-2014-FJ-Cruiser-BLACK-p109350070) makes some cool 3D printed key fob cases. The GX 470 uses the same key fob as the FJ Cruiser, so I ordered 2 of them in different color combos, seen above. I also installed new [CR1616](https://amzn.to/2MU7wuz) batteries, and both keys work perfect now.

I also found out this thing is difficult to park, and ordered a new 9" head unit to replace the stock radio.
