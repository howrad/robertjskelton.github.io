This is a post for my own knowledge, to keep track of what colors I've painted what rooms in my house on Citrus.

* Guest Bathroom - Fresh Arboretum PPG Eggshell, PPG83-310. 50 GY 74/273.

* Living room, hallways - Dorian Gray, SW7017 eggshell.

* Master Bedroom, Accent Wall - SW Naval Infinity, SW6244 Eggshell Ultra Deep.

* Master Suite, everything else - SW Laid-back Beige, HGSW3127.

* "Drum Room", multi-purpose room attached to the kitchen - HC141 Cemented Deal, Sherwin Williams. This is the only paint I've bought an actual paint store, as opposed to Lowe's or Home Depot. Sherwin Williams had paint 40% off.

* Office - Behr Pro Fresh Croissant, Eggshell, PR334.

* Laundry Room - SW Swimming Eggshell, SW6764.

* Alex's Room - Behr Pro PR333, Exotic Blossom Eggshell.

* Primer - Kilz Pro-X Interior Primer, P10. I do 2 coats of this when converting brown wood to white.

* Trim - Behr Marquee Interior Gloss Enamel,  Semi-Brilliant, green can. I finish baseboards and other wood trim in a coat or two of this.

* Exterior trim - Brevard Recycles Harmony, Exterior Latex. This was free paint from Ace Hardware.
