&lt;h1 id=&quot;tldr&quot;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dude rents my nice Corvette on Turo, his bi-polar girlfriend vandalizes it, it takes 46 days for Turo to pay to get &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of it fixed, and they wouldn’t fix some of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/daniel.martinez.9822?eid=ARA1sLcJCI6aBEHu94oDyZUMBivz-L4RagzNM8K8-3gZ19GkX3xu6JMc-Tz3LdSULecDuvp0h7VbpOz-&amp;amp;timeline_context_item_type=intro_card_relationship&amp;amp;timeline_context_item_source=100004641037329&quot;&gt;Daniel B&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/atty4streets&quot;&gt;Martinez Jr&lt;/a&gt;, age 37, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://themartinezlaw.com&quot;&gt;local attorney&lt;/a&gt;, rented my &lt;a href=&quot;https://turo.com/rentals/cars/fl/palm-bay/chevrolet-corvette/381353&quot;&gt;2016 Corvette 2LT&lt;/a&gt; from Jan 3 to Jan 5 on a website called &lt;a href=&quot;https://turo.com/c/roberts974&quot;&gt;Turo&lt;/a&gt;. Turo is a website where you can rent your personal car to other people, and Turo provides insurance. Kinda like AirBNB for cars. He had rented my Corvette for a weekend previously, and only put 10 miles on it. The other time he rented my car, I had to go through his dad in order to pick my car up, since he wouldn’t answer his phone or texts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;timeline&quot;&gt;Timeline&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jan-3&quot;&gt;Jan 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12:30 PM - Daniel picks up my Corvette, shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/turo/before.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jan-4&quot;&gt;Jan 4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11:55 PM - At nearly midnight, a Palm Bay Police Officer, Matt, arrives at my house asking if I owned a blue Chevrolet. I do. He informs me that Daniel had left my car abandoned at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cumberland+Farms/@28.0791818,-80.6409332,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88de0e04064cc945:0xc10058927e69d5c2!8m2!3d28.0791818!4d-80.6387392&quot;&gt;Cumberland Farms gas station on 192 and Dairy Rd in West Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt passes my cell phone number on to a West Melbourne police officer on the scene at the gas station, who calls me. He informs me that my window was broken on my car, and I should come down there and get the car. He said that Daniel’s mother was at the gas station and she had my Corvette key. I get a ride there, and a West Melbourne Police officer is there, who leaves before I get to talk to him, and Daniel’s mother is there. I have just 1 key for the Corvette, and the officer said Daniel’s mother had it. She didn’t. She then drove to her house (where Daniel lives) to get my key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;damage&quot;&gt;Damage&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/turo/no_window.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;No Window&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The driver window was knocked out and busted on the ground. There was damage on the drivers door and mirror. A scratch on the hatchback. A piece of the front grill missing (this was pre-existing damage, as I later found out). The splitter under the front grill was damaged. A scratch in the leather on the passenger interior. Glass everywhere. The targa top was removed and placed in the hatch, and it was raining, and I had no way to put the top back on since Daniel had my key. Who knows how long it had been raining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/turo/roof_scrape.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Roof Scrape&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She arrived back about 20 minutes later with a key, and I pop the hatch to put the top back on. The top is in terrible condition, with scratches and deep scrapes all over it. It was like someone used the painted part of the top as an ice sled, or hockey puck. Just really bad shape. I put the top back on to keep the water out of the car, and a trash bag over the lack of drivers window. I waited for the officer to come back to get the police report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/turo/side.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Side&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had talked to the employees at the Cumberland Farms gas station. They said they got the whole thing on video. My car was parked in the front corner spot, right under 2 cameras. Daniel’s girlfriend, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/marina.rogers.739&quot;&gt;Marina&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/marinarogers112/&quot;&gt;Rogers&lt;/a&gt;, age 21, found out that Daniel had cheated on her and was trying to attack Daniel while he was driving, and he didn’t like that. He pulled over and parked my Corvette at a gas station, then got an Uber home. She was mad she couldn’t attack him, so she vandalized my car. The Cumberland Farms employee said she punched the drivers window three times, then grabbed the top of the window and leaned back with all her weight to break the window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;police-interaction&quot;&gt;Police Interaction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/turo/police.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Police&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cumberland Farms employee said I couldn’t see or retrieve the video evidence without the police. A West Melbourne police officer, Casey, ID#745, finally showed back up to the scene, and gave me a case number, &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/docs/police_report.pdf&quot;&gt;2019-00000441&lt;/a&gt;. Casey told me I can go through Turo, mine or Daniel’s Insurance, or small claims court in order to get my car fixed. He also said what Daniel’s girlfriend did is not a crime, since it isn’t a crime to vandalize someone else’s car. The damage was considered civil, as opposed to criminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found out through Casey that Daniel’s girlfriend, Marina Rogers, had been checked into a local mental health institution, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.circlesofcare.org/current1/home-page.html&quot;&gt;Circles of Care&lt;/a&gt;. The cop said she was bi-polar. Daniel’s mom said she was really drunk. Daniel did not inform me of any damage to my car, he never messaged me or called me back, and did not seem remorseful about this event in the slightest. After viewing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/docs/police_report.pdf&quot;&gt;police report&lt;/a&gt;, it appears Marina Rogers was drunk and suicidal. The officer recognized this, and enacted the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Mental_Health_Act&quot;&gt;Baker Act&lt;/a&gt; to bring her to the mental facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jan-5&quot;&gt;Jan 5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12:30 AM Picked up the Corvette at Cumberland Farms, drove it home and vacuumed up glass&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1:26 AM - Opened up a damage claim with Turo with photo/video walkthrough after I got home&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10AM - Cleaned up the car some more. Noted that Daniel left a $1,300 deposit slip and some blank checks from Wells Fargo in the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/turo/mirror.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mirror&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jan-6&quot;&gt;Jan 6&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No response from Turo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jan-7&quot;&gt;Jan 7&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got a damage quote from John Bias, owner of &lt;a href=&quot;https://acesautobodyshop.com&quot;&gt;Ace’s Body Shop &lt;/a&gt;- 8k&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Called Daniel at his office, left a message with his secretary. Told her the damage was 8k. She said not to worry and that Daniel would make it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Messaged Turo Damage Claims with the 8k damage estimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No response from Turo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jan-8&quot;&gt;Jan 8&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No response from Turo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Called Daniel on his cell, left a voicemail to call me back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No response from Daniel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jan-9&quot;&gt;Jan 9&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got a quote from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gerbercollision.com/locations/palm-bay-fl&quot;&gt;Gerber Collision&lt;/a&gt;, with their associate JP. Quote was 7.3k, + 1.5k to 5k more for new seat and dealer code resets. So even higher than Ace’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sent Turo follow up email with second quote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Called Turo support - got Sylvia. She said to wait for the claims specialist to contact me later today. The Claims Specialist’s name is Donovan Durr, 415-941-0706, donovan.durr@turo.com&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submitted a request to West Melbourne PD for the case report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donovan Durr from Turo support contacted me. He mentioned that the grill already had a piece missing when I had rented it before, according to the pictures. I looked, and he’s right. The grill even had that piece missing when I bought it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel finally messaged me that night, saying he’s been busy with a jury and asking what he needed to do to take care of this. I messaged him back saying 8k was the damage cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jan-10&quot;&gt;Jan 10&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No responses from Turo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No response from Daniel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cleaned the interior with soap and water and was able to get the scuffing off of the drivers seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jan-11&quot;&gt;Jan 11&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Received email from Donovan at Turo, requesting photos of scratches and damage with a ruler next to it. Photos sent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Received &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/docs/police_report.pdf&quot;&gt;police report&lt;/a&gt; from West Melbourne Police Dept, forwarded to Donovan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call with Donovan Durr at 3:30PM EST. Said he is reviewing with his supervisor. Follow-up in 1 business day. Nothing else to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No response from Daniel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jan-12&quot;&gt;Jan 12&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No response from Daniel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Donovan at Turo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I reviewed this claim with my supervisor. We’re going to cover the damage to the driver’s side door, the mirror, and the top in that area. We’re going to be denying the damage to the rear passenger quarter panel as we cannot determine if that scratch may have been there based on the pre-trip photos provided for that area and the difficulty of seeing the scratch due to its nature.
For the splitter, we would not be able to cover that as we would need pre-trip photos of the undercarriage unfortunately. Although we don’t have pre-trip photos of the interior, we will reimburse you $200 for the interior as well as cover any water damage that may have occurred to due to the top being left off. Your shop of choice will need to file a supplement request for that portion of the claim.
Finally, I want to do a final review on the scratches on the targa top that go down towards the passenger’s side door. I was advised to move forward with a denial for it as my supervisor wasn’t able to see the damage in the post trip photo we looked at, but as we have a few others on file(and the video from the scene), I want to make sure that we are making the right decision. As I do not work Tuesday through Saturday, I do typically do not work on Mondays, but I will see if I can get her to take a second look at that area. If we decide to move forward with coverage, I will go ahead and get that added to our estimate and we should have this fully resolved by early next week. Thank you for your patience as I know this is frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jan-13&quot;&gt;Jan 13&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel messaged me on the Turo app, saying he has elected to go through Turo to settle this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No response from Turo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joined &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/1825468964354089/&quot;&gt;Turo Owners group&lt;/a&gt; on FB for advice on how to deal with Turo. General advice is to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fairclaims.com&quot;&gt;FairClaims&lt;/a&gt; and to not take the first number Turo offers you. Just escalate it when they low ball you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jan-14&quot;&gt;Jan 14&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No response from Turo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noticed that Turo has delisted my Corvette from their website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jan-15&quot;&gt;Jan 15&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created account on ResolveAClaim app, as instructed by Turo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snapsheet estimator was Marvin Acosta. Snapsheet is a third party that Turo goes through to get damage estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Donovan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My supervisor took a second look at the claim and we will be able to go ahead and cover the scratches on the top as well. So that would be everything covered except for this scratch attached to this message, that portion of the front grill that was already missing and the damage to the splitter. I will go ahead and have an estimate written up at this time. If you have any questions, feel free to let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jan-16&quot;&gt;Jan 16&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Received email from SnapSheet, offering me $1,169.51 to cover the damages. The denied a large part of the damage to my car. They said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have no pre-trip photos of the undercarriage, the damage to the front grill is pre-existing, and we cannot determine if the scratch on the rear hatch on the passenger’s side is pre-existing based on the pre-trip photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Based on the circumstances, I regret to inform you this claim is ineligible for coverage because pre-existing damage and areas claimed without pre-trip photos are not covered under our policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jan-17&quot;&gt;Jan 17&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accepted $1,169.51 payment from Turo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donovan said $200 interior damage refund will go directly to my earnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Left a message for Ace’s on dropping off Vette and working on supplements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jan-18&quot;&gt;Jan 18&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brought Vette to Ace’s, John took pictures and said that he’d work on supplements with Turo/Snapsheet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got a call from John at Ace’s Body Shop. Said Corvette is painted, total is about $4700. Still waiting on Snapsheet to send over the supplement approval. John said that Snapsheet is not wanting to put in an OEM window glass, however, there seem to be no aftermarket window glass parts available anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John said he has been working with Michael Ecker, who is an adjuster for Snapsheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called Snapsheet support. They said my supplement is approved for the full amount that Ace’s will charge. They said they sent that approval to Turo on February 7, and Turo is the middle man and has to send it to Ace’s Body shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Called Turo to follow up - waited 27 minutes before requesting a call back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got a call back from Richard at Turo. He said he is approving it today, sending me and the body shop an email with information today, and that then I can claim the remaining ~$3600 from Turo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Called Ace’s to let them know the full supplement was approved and will be sent over today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feb-9&quot;&gt;Feb 9&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No response from Turo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feb-10&quot;&gt;Feb 10&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No response from Turo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feb-11&quot;&gt;Feb 11&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heard back from Donovan at Turo Support, the supplement went from Snapsheet to him. He said that Snapsheet incorrectly listed the damage as on the windshield instead of the drivers window, so he is getting them to redo it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feb-12&quot;&gt;Feb 12&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John from Ace’s called, the car is finished except putting a few trim pieces on. Windows on and tinted, paint looks good. Planned to pick up car on Friday, Feb 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heard back from Donovan with an supplement payment of $3,066.96.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That would put the total paid  at $3,066.96 + $1,169.51 + $200 = $4,436.47&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked Donovan about getting the additional amount owed, and mentioned using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fairclaims.com/&quot;&gt;FairClaims&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total Charges from Ace’s = $4,538.47&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feb-13&quot;&gt;Feb 13&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No response from Turo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No response from Turo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feb-15&quot;&gt;Feb 15&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corvette detailed at Ace’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picked up car from Ace’s, total charge was $4,538.47, which I paid out of pocket. These clear protector on the drivers door over the paint was not installed, so he said for me to come back up next week to get it installed, it is already paid for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John found a full container of hair gel in the car that Daniel had left in it from the rental.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No response from Turo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feb-16&quot;&gt;Feb 16&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donovan from Turo said that he has submitted the second supplement payment for authorization to a supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feb-17&quot;&gt;Feb 17&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No response from Turo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feb-18&quot;&gt;Feb 18&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No response from Turo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feb-19&quot;&gt;Feb 19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Received $316.23 from Turo on second supplement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total paid from Turo =  $1,169.51 + $200 + $3,066.96 + $316.23 = $4,752.70.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total paid to Ace’s = $4,538.47&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after all was finished, I got to keep $214.13, but I have a large scratch on my hatch that Turo would not cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feb-20&quot;&gt;Feb 20&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://turo.com/rentals/cars/fl/palm-bay/chevrolet-corvette/381353&quot;&gt;Corvette relisted&lt;/a&gt;, required multiple day rentals and higher rate per day, along with a cleaning fee if not returned clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I want to thank &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Aces-Autobody-1381810925437470/&quot;&gt;Ace’s Body Shop&lt;/a&gt;. They did a great job on my car, and John went above and beyond filling out multiple supplements for Turo and Snapsheet. Seriously, thanks, you guys were great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took 46 days for Turo to fix damages on my car, and hours of my time dealing with Turo Support, getting quotes from body shops, requesting police reports, and sending in pictures. I was very unsatisfied with both the quality and punctuality of Turo Support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have learned that, if you rent your car on Turo, it should be a car you don’t care about, and to take 50+ pictures before and after every rental. Part of my claim was denied because I only took the 5 required before and after pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turo is not on your side, and will do everything possibly to pay you as little as possible. It took me almost 7 weeks to get my damages paid for. I was lucky that I have another car, or else I would have been without a car for a majority of those 7 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://turo.com/rentals/cars/fl/palm-bay/chevrolet-corvette/381353&quot;&gt;relisted my Corvette&lt;/a&gt;, and will requiring a higher cost per day, and  require more days per rental.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fixed the 2 keys for my Lexus. The battery in both keys was dead, so the remote didn’t work. The screws to get the battery out were stripped, so I have to destroy each case to get in. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ajtdesign-llc.com/online-store/Injection-Fob-2008-2014-FJ-Cruiser-BLACK-p109350070&quot;&gt;AJT Designs&lt;/a&gt; makes some cool 3D printed key fob cases. The GX 470 uses the same key fob as the FJ Cruiser, so I ordered 2 of them in different color combos, seen above. I also installed new &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2MU7wuz&quot;&gt;CR1616&lt;/a&gt; batteries, and both keys work perfect now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/lexus2/parking.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Parking&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also found out this thing is difficult to park, and ordered a new 9” head unit to replace the stock radio.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Cleaning Headlights and Other Improvements on the Lexus</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/Cleaning-Headlights-and-other-improvements-on-the-Lexus/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Cleaning Headlights and Other Improvements on the Lexus" /><published>2019-01-28T11:00:14-05:00</published><updated>2019-01-28T11:00:14-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Cleaning-Headlights-and-other-improvements-on-the-Lexus</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Cleaning-Headlights-and-other-improvements-on-the-Lexus/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/lexus2/in_process.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Clean Headlights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve cleaned the headlights on my Lexus, using toothpaste and car wax. Materials included a tube of toothpaste with baking soda, some wax, an old toothbrush, and some rags. Simply spread the toothpaste around the headlights in a circular motion, similar to waxing. Let it sit for a few minutes, then wipe off with some damp rags. Then wax your headlights to apply a sealant on your lights. Toothpaste is not a good sealant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed a huge difference on the fog lights, which were really cloudy. The headlights themselves improved some, but they weren’t that bad to start with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also installed a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2MBqzcI&quot;&gt;gas cap&lt;/a&gt;, which got rid of a few engine error codes, and some new &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2RSoajZ&quot;&gt;hood struts&lt;/a&gt;. The hood fell on me while I was changing some bulbs the other week, and I didn’t want that to happen again. The hood struts took about 20 minutes to change, and I needed a 12mm socket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/Lexus-GX470-LED-Interior-Lights/&quot;&gt;installing new Interior LEDs&lt;/a&gt; on my Lexus GX470, and here’s a bit about exterior lights. I installed new low beams, high beams, daytime running lamps, fog lights, and reverse lights. The install of all of these lights took about an hour. For the front lights, you just have to remove a few engine covers, and for the reverse lights, you have to remove the rear door cover. The fog lights were the most difficult, as you have to get under the car with a 10mm socket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was very happy with the outcome - for under $110, you get a higher end look out of your vehicle, but also much better visibility. The reverse lights and high beams are incredible. My only complaint was that the fogs were yellower than I’d hoped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a list of lights I used, you need 2 of each bulb:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2SUTGdu&quot;&gt;H11 - Low Beams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2FyBJgO&quot;&gt;9005 - High Beams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2sv2Dyq&quot;&gt;H3 - Fog Lights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2SWAmN5&quot;&gt;7440 - Reverse Lights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2S6HvcZ&quot;&gt;194 - Daytime Running Lights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low Beams Only
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/lexus/lights1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Low&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High Beams - these give amazing visibility when driving!

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to thank the kind members of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/LexusGXOR&quot;&gt;GXOR Facebook group&lt;/a&gt; for their suggestions. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pfranleds.com/gx-470-1/&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a handy website for all the light bulbs in a GX470.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Final Bedroom Remodel</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/final-bedroom-remodel/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Final Bedroom Remodel" /><published>2019-01-04T11:00:14-05:00</published><updated>2019-01-04T11:00:14-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/final-bedroom-remodel</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/final-bedroom-remodel/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/owen/23.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Owen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Owen finally moved out and I got the chance to renovate that bedroom. We installed new switches, outlets, floors, ceiling fan, and paint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total renovation cost was under $400! I already had extra light switches, underlayment, and tools to install everything. Here is what else I bought:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lowes.com/pd/Harbor-Breeze-Centreville-42-in-Brushed-Nickel-LED-Indoor-Ceiling-Fan-with-Light-Kit/1000259351&quot;&gt;Ceiling Fan&lt;/a&gt;: $54&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Switch covers: $2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lowes.com/pd/Style-Selections-Ginger-Hickory-8-05-in-W-x-3-97-ft-L-Smooth-Wood-Plank-Laminate-Flooring/50243461&quot;&gt;Laminate (170 sqft)&lt;/a&gt;: $150&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lowes.com/pd/SimpleSolutions-2-37-in-x-78-74-in-Natural-Oak-Ginger-Hickory-4-n-1-Floor-Moulding/1000094233&quot;&gt;Transition Piece&lt;/a&gt;: $27&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lowes.com/pd/SimpleSolutions-0-75-in-x-94-5-in-Natural-Oak-Ginger-Hickory-Quarter-Round-Floor-Moulding/1000094225&quot;&gt;Quarter round&lt;/a&gt;: $70 - this is enough for 2 more bedrooms as well&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lowes.com/pd/EverTrue-5-25-in-x-12-ft-Interior-Primed-MDF-Baseboard-Moulding/1000444895&quot;&gt;Baseboards&lt;/a&gt;: $77&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Total = $378&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before, it was full of green carpet from 1996, gross walls with gross stuff all over them, an out of date fan, and ugly old baseboards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/owen/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Owen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took off all the switch and outlet covers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/owen/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Owen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Removed the baseboards and painted the window trim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/owen/4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Owen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Painted the room. I had already painted around the door frames and installed new 6 panel doors, which I took off for this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/owen/5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Owen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used some bleach to clean up that black grossness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/owen/6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Owen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paint, paint, paint. I did 2 coats, and then touched up random spots afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/owen/7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Owen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started ripping out all the carpet. This took 2 weeks worth of trash bins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/owen/8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Owen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then took out all the carpet tack strips. The best technique for this that I’ve found is to use a flat head shovel, and have a large trash can nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/owen/9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Owen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you can see the new outlets and switches going in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/owen/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Owen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clean the floors before starting to install your laminate. I officially have no more carpet in my house!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/owen/11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Owen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dogs help. No they don’t, they get in the way, but they’re fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/owen/12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Owen&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/owen/13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Owen&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/owen/14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Owen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2RvdhDr&quot;&gt;underlayment&lt;/a&gt; going in. This is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2RvdhDr&quot;&gt;same underlayment&lt;/a&gt; I had used a few years ago when I did the rest of my house in this laminate. One roll was enough for my entire living room and 3 bedrooms, with plenty still leftover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/owen/15.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Owen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New 42” ceiling fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/owen/16.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Owen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First laminate piece in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/owen/17.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Owen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half a room, the easy half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/owen/18.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Owen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex measuring for the angled cuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/owen/19.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Owen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything but the last row in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/owen/20.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Owen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All done except the baseboards! It took me and Alex about 2 hours to put in the entire room, we were booking it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/owen/21.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Owen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baseboards in, it took me a few hours of working by myself one afternoon to finish these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/owen/22.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Owen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also installed laminate matching quarter round, which I had never put in before. The rest of my rooms have white quarter round, or no quarter round. I think that these segmented off rooms, like a bedroom, look great with floor matching quarter round. I’m planning to put it in the other 2 bedrooms, which currently have no quarter round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of life’s biggest expenses is transportation, especially cars. I love cars, and love getting different cars. I get bored driving the same vehicle for more than a few years. You could imagine this would be expensive, but it doesn’t have to be. I’m 26 and have owned 9 cars (10 if you count my fiancés Fiat 500, not listed below), and I’ve not lost much money on them at all. The biggest downside is that you have to pay registration and taxes on every car you buy, but some of that can be tax deductible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list that follows is all of the cars I’ve owned, how much I paid and sold them for, how many miles I put on them, and about how expensive it was to own each one. I’ve included insurance costs, city/highway MPG, and the cost of oil changes and registration so that you can see how affordable each was to own. My first 3 cars I owned in high school, so my helped me out by paying for gas, insurance, and registration. Also, 7 of these cars were Rear Wheel Drive, manual transmission cars, and I have owned two silver on black V8 automatic AWD SUVs. 6 of the 9 were American made and had no issues, and 2 were German made and had so many issues. The one Japanese car has been great so far.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Oil Changes: $30 for standard oil change, every 3,000 to 5,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cars/93mustang.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1993 Mustang&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This car was bought by my parents for me and my brother to learn to drive a manual transmission. I broke the clutch in it, and the A/C compressor went out in it, which cost about $600 to fix both. We owned it for a few years as an extra car, and sold it for more than we paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-1996-ford-mustang&quot;&gt;2. 1996 Ford Mustang&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bought: $3,600 / 118,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sold: $2,400 / 135,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MPG: 23/28, regular gas&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Engine: 3.6L 6-cylinder, 150HP&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cars/96mustang.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1996 Mustang&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the first car I bought myself, the older, silver Mustang in the middle of the picture. I put a $70 Cold Air Intake on it. Other than that, I did no major work on the car, so it had no expenses outside of gas and oil changes. I originally sold the car for $3,200, but the buyer blew a head gasket on the way home. This really surprised me, since after I had 17,000 issue-free miles, they broke a major part in a 5 mile drive home. Since they were family friends, I took it back, and sold it as is a week later for $800 less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-1999-chevrolet-camaro&quot;&gt;3. 1999 Chevrolet Camaro&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bought: $4,000 / 99,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sold: $3,600 / 115,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cars/camaro.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1999 Camaro&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought the Camaro before heading to college as something more exciting – it had T-Tops! The picture doesn’t portray how enthralled I was. I drove this at the beginning of my college career and had no issues with it. Just a couple hundred dollars upgrading the headlights and front grill, hey, I was 18! When I sold it after a few years, I didn’t lose much money to upgrade to my next car, which was a…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-2004-cadillac-cts-v&quot;&gt;4. 2004 Cadillac CTS-V&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bought: $17,800 / 49,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sold: $13,000 / 99,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MPG: 16/23, premium gas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Insurance: $120/mo for full coverage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engine: 5.7L 8-cylinder, 400HP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oil Changes: $100 for full synthetic oil change, every 10,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taxes/Registration: Unsure, parents paid for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cars/ctsv.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2004 CTS-V&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought this with the money I had saved from summer jobs and my first semester of Co-oping as a Test Engineer. It came with new tires, I got one set of new tires for free a few years later from my brother (he won them), and I sold it needing new tires. The CTS-V was an amazing car: a luxury sport sedan with a Corvette Z06 engine and a 6-speed manual transmission. I loved it! However, the insurance was really high, and so were the gas costs. This was the longest I had ever owned a car, which was about 4 years. I sold it when I moved down to Florida for my first real Engineering job. I still find myself wanting a car like this again, and they are still selling used years later for the same prices. No more depreciation on these, unfortunately for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-2008-chevrolet-corvette&quot;&gt;5. 2008 Chevrolet Corvette&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bought: $27,500 / 36,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sold: $26,500 /49,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MPG: 23/30, premium gas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Insurance: $90/mo for full coverage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engine: 6.2L 8-cylinder, 430HP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oil Changes: $100 for full synthetic oil change, every 10,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taxes/Registration: $3,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cars/c6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2008 Corvette&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought the Corvette after getting my first paycheck as a full time employee after college. A bright blue Corvette with a targa top in perfect Florida weather, why not? A few months later, I was wondering how bad of a financial decision it really was. My dad and brother gave me 0% loans since I couldn’t pay for all of it at once, and I was paying them about $1,000/month to pay it off quickly. It took about 6 months to pay off. Finally selling my CTS-V really helped. I owned the Corvette for a little over a year, and luckily sold it for not much of a loss in order to pay off the down payment on my house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying a Corvette and a house in the same year might not be the best financial decision, but it worked out for me once I sold the Vette. This was the nicest and fastest car I had owned at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expenses on this were really low, since insurance is super cheap and it got relatively good MPG for a sports car. Everyone wonders how the insurance low, so think about this: Who buys a Corvette, and what do they do with them? Most Corvette owners are 60+ and retired, and they use their Corvette as a weekend car or cruiser, not a daily driver. This means they are garaged the majority of the time, and there are not very many insurance claims on them. This drives the insurance price pretty low, which was great for me! Most people in Corvette Clubs like to brag how few miles they put on their Vette, I was the opposite. I put about 13,000 miles on mine in the year I owned it, and loved every single one of them. It made me want to get back into one once I was more financially stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-1999-porsche-boxster&quot;&gt;6. 1999 Porsche Boxster&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bought: $5,500 / 85,000 miles
Sold: $5,000  / 89,000 miles
MPG: 19/25, premium gas
Insurance: $50/mo for legal minimum
Engine: 2.5L 6-cylinder, 200HP
Oil Changes: $95 for full synthetic oil change, every 7,000 miles
Taxes/Registration: $500&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cars/boxster.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1999 Boxster&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought the Porsche as a replacement to Corvette, which I sold to pay towards the down payment on my house. The difference in selling my Corvette and buying a Porsche was over $21,000! My co-workers wondered why I “upgraded” from a Corvette to a Porsche, and their jaw dropped when they find out I only paid $6,000 after tax and registration for it. The insurance for full coverage on it was about $130/mo, which I thought was insane on a car that’s so cheap. Therefore, I just went for the legal minimum. My thoughts were that if I wreck it, I can just buy another car. I’m also quite confident in my driving abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called it my cheap beater Porsche, and that’s not too far off. I converted the non-functional automatic convertible top to a manually-operated top, and I just leave it down all the time. The back window was plastic that has faded to yellow, so it had terrible visibility when the top is up. I spent $50 on new tail light bulbs and a new headlight switch, since those didn’t work when I bought it. Luckily for me, I picked this up for a steal on Craigslist, and bought it the same day it was posted. I loved driving a cheap car that I don’t care about anymore! I kept this about 9 months. I put about $350 into new brakes and rotors. I did them myself, since the dealer quoted $2,700 to do it. When I sold it on eBay, it needed a new water pump, which was about $700 installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lost about $1,000 to drive this for close to a year, not bad. I sold it to buy my first automatic car, and first non-sports car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-2005-bmw-x5-48&quot;&gt;7. 2005 BMW X5 4.8&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bought: $7,000 / 102,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sold: $7,005 in trade-in / 108,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MPG: 14/19, premium gas (ouch)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Insurance: $67/mo for legal minimum&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engine: 4.8L 8-cylinder, 360HP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oil Changes: None yet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taxes/Registration: $700&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cars/x5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2005 X5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought this awesome BMW SUV. It was $72,000 new, and I bought it for 10% of that. It was large inside, had a panoramic sunroof, Bluetooth, and heated seats in the front and back. Perfect for Florida! It came with huge 20″ rims that are 315 in the back. I got lots of compliments on the wheels. The car was enjoyable to drive, the A/C was so cold, and it felt like it owned the road. It’s not a sports car, but it’ll scoot. 360HP in this SUV is no slouch. It’s got torque to tow as well. The gas mileage is horrific on this car, and it holds 25 gallons of premium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never bought new tires on it, but it had a TON of problems. The inside driver door panel was off for at least half the time I owned it, and I replaced almost every part in there myself. The window barely worked. I ended up using a zip tie to solder a piece of plastic together inside the door. The BMW and Porsche I had might have been lemons, It needed some engine work before I tried selling it private party, then ended up trading it in on this…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;8-2016-chevrolet-corvette&quot;&gt;8. 2016 Chevrolet Corvette&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bought: $40,000 / 44,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sold: Not yet, keeping at least 4 years!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MPG: 23/32+, premium gas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Insurance: $110/mo for excellent coverage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engine: 6.2L 8-cylinder, 455HP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oil Changes: None yet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taxes/Registration: ~$2,500&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/turo/vette.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Corvette&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newest car and by far the most expensive car I’ve ever owned. Something about lifestyle creep… I got a 1.49% interest rate 48 month car loan on a USED car. Found this 1-owner, higher mileage C7 Corvette at a dealer. It was the exact combo I wanted, blue exterior and brown/tan interior, 2LT, manual transmission. It was Certified Pre-Owned, so it has free oil changes and services for a few years, plus it was a better price than any 2016 for sale in the country at the time. I haggled for a while, got up to leave a few times, and got about 3k off the dealer price and got more than I paid for my BMW on trade in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2016 came with a front camera so you don’t hit the front bumper parking, and a flat bottom steering wheel. This is such a nice car, and I’m making some money on the side &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/rent-other-peoples-cars-with-turo/&quot;&gt;renting it with Turo&lt;/a&gt;. I was really tired of how expensive the BMW was and how unreliable it was, so I was happy to pay a premium to get into a reliable American car again. Plus it has cylinder deactivation to run on 4-cylinders when you want to, which helped me get 36 MPG on a road trip to Tampa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An update on my Vette for 2019: I’ve put 12,000 miles on it this year, and it’s gotten an oil change and new O2 sensors under warranty. Great, reliable car! I’ve also made almost $1,500 renting it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/rent-other-peoples-cars-with-turo/&quot;&gt;Turo!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;9-2007-lexus-gx470&quot;&gt;9. 2007 Lexus GX470&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bought: $10,000 / 145,000 miles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sold: Not yet, and not planning on selling&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MPG: 15/19, any gas, I still use premium&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Insurance: $80/mo for excellent coverage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engine: 4.7L 8-cylinder, 270HP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oil Changes: None yet, but I’ll do them myself&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taxes/Registration: $1,700&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cars/lexus.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;GX470&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We needed something larger than a Corvette or Fiat to move our dogs around and do more home improvement projects, so I wanted to get something reliable SUV that would last a very long time. I did my research and decided on a Toyota 4Runner, with leather and a V8. So the 4th generation (2003-2009) Toyota 4Runner V8 Limited. Unfortunately, those are rare, and relatively expensive. Then I found out that Lexus made the same car, with more factory options and it’s even nicer than the 4Runner, has a V8, leather, and it sells for less than a V8 Limited 4Runner. That sold me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was originally planning to buy a 2003 model in Pennsylvania for $5,000, but it had rust, was a little rough, and the owner was seeming like he was never going to deliver it. I was paying him to drive it down, but he flaked on me 3 separate times. I had searches set up on every website you can think of, and not many come up for sale. One ended up showing up in Melbourne, FL, where I live, for 10k. It was more than I was wanting to spend, but it was much lower miles, newer, and nicer than I was planning on buying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was this one that I bought. I was going to go look at it, so I scheduled and appointment with this local car dealer for the next day. They called me that day and said the car had already sold, pending financing. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They called me back another day later and said financing fell through, so I went down that day and bought it, putting almost $7k of the purchase on a Capital One Venture card to get a signing bonus! This car was nearly perfect, super low miles for the model, recent maintenance on the timing belt and water pump, new battery, tires, brakes - it needs nothing. I got this car for below market (the car would’ve sold the next day if I didn’t buy it), and I plan on driving it until it dies. This is a car that needs very little maintenance since it’s a Toyota, it’ll run 3,4,500k miles, and I’m already loving it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So those are the cars I’ve owned, and the details on how much they cost to buy and own. Do you have any good stories about cars and how they effected your financial plans?

&lt;h3 id=&quot;financial&quot;&gt;Financial&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Max out my Roth IRA ($6k)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Max out my fiancés Roth IRA ($6k)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Max out my 401k ($19k)&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Have a total of 150k invested in everything&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Roll over HSA to Fidelity. I’ll be married in 2019, and we’re getting better health insurance, so I lose access to my HSA. The existing HSA will charge high fees if I’m not contributing to it, so I’m moving it to a no-fee Fidelity HSA.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t buy a car&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;house&quot;&gt;House&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Redo Closet in Owen’s Room&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finish second bathroom renovation (shower, floors)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finish master closet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Paint outside of house&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grow grass in side yard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Redo gutters by the side yard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start composting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Redo lavender garden, maybe move a fruit tree from the back to here&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add a front garden&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rip out grass around fruit trees and add soil/composting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pressure wash pool area&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Redo the kitchen. This is an expensive one that I hope to get to this year, it was also on my list for last year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;education&quot;&gt;Education&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pass 2 Georgia Tech classes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get Elizabeth and my college diplomas framed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Obtain a AWS Professional level Certification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other&quot;&gt;Other&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Get married&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Weight down to 185&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Beat Final Fantasy 9&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to Costa Rica on a Honeymoon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recycle plastic bags&lt;/li&gt;

Here is a recap of my goals for 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;financial&quot;&gt;Financial&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Max out my Roth IRA ($5.5k) - PASS.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Max out my fiancés Roth IRA ($5.5k) - FAIL, we set up an auto-contribution, but ended up about 1k short. We still have until April to finish this goal, which we will.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Max out my 401k ($18.5k) - PASS, or really close.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Max out my HSA ($3.45k) - PASS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep 3k in an Ally Emergency Fund - FAIL, I had more than 3k in there multiple times but I always take it out. I use my emergency fund different than most.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have 30k saved in taxable investment accounts for a down payment on our next house - FAIL, reached 19k.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reach a Net Worth of 260k - FAIL. I hit 259.5k in June! The market fluctuated so much that I ended the year with about 255k.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have a total of 100k invested - PASS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;house&quot;&gt;House&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/pool-enclosure-replacement/&quot;&gt;Fix Pool Cage&lt;/a&gt; - PASS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Redo Owen’s Room - PASS. One of my roommates finally moved out, so we redid that room. It was pretty disgusting. About $600 in materials and some sweat and it looks amazing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Redo the kitchen - FAIL. This one is going to be expensive and I hope to get it done by the end of 2019. I did buy a much needed new fridge!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finish master bathroom - PASS. We installed new floors, vanity, tub, toilet, shower, etc. It’s nice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finish master closet - FAIL. The layout of the small master closet kinda stinks, so I want to redo the shelving.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/$500-bathroom-remodel/&quot;&gt;Finish 2nd bathroom&lt;/a&gt; - FAIL. We painted the cabinets and walls and put in a new mirror and fixtures, but have yet to do the floors or shower. That is a priority in 2019.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Paint outside of house - FAIL. I got lots of free exterior paint but never got the drive to actually complete this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Landscaping - FAIL. I put in some fruit trees and a lavender garden, but I need to put in tons more work outside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;education&quot;&gt;Education&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently got another car, my &lt;a href=&quot;https://rskelton.com/drive-cool-cars-on-a-budget/&quot;&gt;10th car ever&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a 2007 Lexus GX470, basically a nicer 4Runner with leather and a V8. I chose this model specifically since it is a very reliable car, with an example of the same engine and chassis running for over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.motoringresearch.com/car-news/man-drives-toyota-1-million-miles-9-years-gets-free-toyota/&quot;&gt;1 Million miles&lt;/a&gt;. Mine only has 145k miles. I asked for an overnight test drive, and took it to pick up a delivery of laminate floors from Lowes before I even purchased it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/lexus/lowes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lowes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I always do to my cars is to replace all the yellow, halogen bulbs with lower power, higher output white LEDs. This makes the car look newer, and visibility is always better. The lights are all relatively easy to replace, you just need a small flat head screwdriver. Note that I did blow a fuse changing the vanity lights, and had to replace a 10A fuse in the fuse box located under the hood. You won’t have to do that if you don’t short the connection, so use something plastic instead of metal to remove those bulbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a list of lights I used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2S3FE8J&quot;&gt;Map Lights: BA9S x2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2UQpLoh&quot;&gt;Vanity Lights: 30mm festoon, thin x2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2S6HvcZ&quot;&gt;Courtesy Lights: 194 x4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2S6HvcZ&quot;&gt;Step Rail Lights: 194 x4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2S6HvcZ&quot;&gt;License Plate Lights: 194 x2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2SaufEu&quot;&gt;Overhead Lights in Rear and Middle Seats: 31mm festoon x2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To replace the license plate lights, I had to take the rear door off. When I bought it, the handle on the inside of that door was broken, so I made a new one. I’ve seen some posts on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/LexusGXOR/&quot;&gt;GXOR&lt;/a&gt;, a great resource for Lexus GX mods, that involve making a new strap from a NATO bracelet or similar. I did similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/lexus/reardooroff.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Door Off&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a rope that we used to use for our hammock and cut it into 3 pieces. I braided it, tight, then ran it through the back. It’s tied up with tons of electrical tape behind the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally redid our front door for good, final product above. We had taken the door off, sanded and painted it about 6 months ago, using the same color “Swimming” as our laundry room. Problem was, we used the same bucket of paint as the laundry room. Interior paint. You can guess how well that held up outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the door after painting with interior paint. Notice the discoloration and bad spots. And the pups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/frontdoor/0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I bought the house, the door was pink/mauve. This is a picture from when I bought the house, the only picture I have of the front door. We originally redid it with new paint, weatherstripping, and hardware, but then had to repaint for good. That interior paint was not going to last on the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/frontdoor/before.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We re-did the whole thing - took the door off the hinges, took off the hardware, sanded, sanded, sanded. You can see all of the different layers: wood, pink/mauve from before, primer, and the interior Swimming paint. We took off different levels in different spots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/frontdoor/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/frontdoor/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/frontdoor/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then applied 4 coats of EXTERIOR Swimming - same color, but better for outdoor use. It’ll hold up much better this time. It looks much lighter with the direct light in the garage.&lt;/p&gt;
