**6. Add Audio Files**
Find your USB drive and drag and drop audio files onto it. Most people seem to recommend playlists, since those will play non stop in your Vette.

**7. Put in in your Vette**
Plug your USB drive into the USB slot either behind the dash, or under the center console. Either one works for audio, in a 2016 at least.
