I made some simple hallway bookshelves. They cost $43 and a few hours of my time.

Materials included brackets and a sheet of 3/4" plywood, cut down to 2 pieces of 9" x 24".

These were then sanded, given 2 coats of primer, then a final coat of Behr white paint.

Make sure to use a level on your brackets, both vertically and horizontally. I used a large textbook to guess how far apart the shelves should be.

The lumber was $13, the 4 brackets were $30, and I already owned the paint and brushes.

Here's the final product with some books! Total of $43 and about 2 hours of time.
