I plastidipped the grill on my Lexus GX470, and I am very happy with the results. It took about 30 minutes of active work, and about 4 hours of waiting, and this was my first time using [Plasti Dip](https://amzn.to/2H7U2dj). I used 1 can of black [Plasti Dip](https://amzn.to/2H7U2dj).

This is the full Chrome grill, before.

The labor is pretty simple - remove about 10 10mm bolts around the grill, up under the hood. I also had to remove 2 bolts on the hood release that were attached. Then just slip the grill off.

I also removed the Lexus logo, so that it stayed chrome instead of black. I think the contrast looks better. I've seen some other people [Plasti Dip](https://amzn.to/2H7U2dj) the whole grill, and it doesn't look as good to me.

The Lexus logo removal involved 2 Phillips screws behind the logo.

Make sure you clean your grill really well. You don't want any bugs or dust on the grill before starting. I applied 8 coats of [Plasti Dip](https://amzn.to/2H7U2dj) on, with 15-30 minutes of drying in between in each coat. It was just like using spray paint. This is after 2 coats.

And this is 6 coats.

And re-installed the grill! Huge improvement.
