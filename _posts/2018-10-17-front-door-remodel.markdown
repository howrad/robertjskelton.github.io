We finally redid our front door for good. We had taken the door off, sanded and painted it about 6 months ago, using the same color "Swimming" as our laundry room. Problem was, we used the same bucket of paint as the laundry room. Interior paint. You can guess how well that held up outside.

We re-did the whole thing - took the door off the hinges, took off the hardware, sanded, sanded, sanded.

I then applied 4 coats of EXTERIOR Swimming - same color, but better for outdoor use. It'll hold up much better this time.
