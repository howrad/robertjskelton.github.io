I recently bought my 12th car, a 2004 Honda S2000, so I'll be doing a few little convenience mods here and there. My first mod is always LEDs, which make the car brighter and more visible, and make it look like a more modern car. Here are the parts I used:

* [Map Lights: 30mm festoon, thin x2](https://amzn.to/2UQpLoh)
* [Trunk Light: 194 x1](https://amzn.to/2S6HvcZ)
* [License Plate Light: 194 x1](https://amzn.to/2S6HvcZ)
* [Accent Light on Front Headlights: 194 x2](https://amzn.to/2S6HvcZ)
* [High Beams: H1 x2](https://amzn.to/2qmq3sF)
* [Reverse Light: T20 7440 x2](https://amzn.to/37n7l4t)

Yeah, the S2000 doesn't have that many lights compared to my GX. Anyways, they're all pretty simple to do. The map lights, you pry off only the clear cover, and there are two notches where it indicates where to put in a screwdriver. The trunk requires no tools to remove. The license plate light is one Phillips screw to change. The front marker lights, which might be an AP2 model only thing, not sure, you CAN change those without removing anything, just turn the tire one way and do the lights you can reach, then go turn the tires the other way to do the other side. Reverse bulbs can be changed from inside of the trunk liner. Easy enough!
