My wife and I have been doing a Keto diet for about 9 months. We have both lost over 30 pounds doing this diet. Since this involves cooking using lots of low carb recipes, I have bookmarked a large collection of recipes we like, here they are.

### Breakfast
* [Jalape√±o Popper Egg Cups](https://www.ruled.me/jalapeno-popper-egg-cups/)

### Snacks
* [Cheese Wraps](https://www.isavea2z.com/no-carb-cheese-wrap-folios-copycat-recipe/)
* [Spinach Artichoke Dip](https://www.wholesomeyum.com/recipes/8-ingredient-spinach-artichoke-dip-low-carb-gluten-free/)- We dip [Whisps](https://amzn.to/2KVZHVX) into this dip.
* [BBQ Bacon Wrapped Lil Smokies](https://www.ruled.me/bbq-bacon-wrapped-smokies/)
* [Sushi](https://www.wholesomeyum.com/recipes/keto-low-carb-sushi-rolls-recipe-healthy/)

### Chicken
* [Pesto Mozzarella and Tomato Stuffed Chicken Breast](https://laughingspatula.com/pesto-mozzarella-and-tomato-stuffed-chicken-breasts/#wprm-recipe-container-5260)
* [Chicken Zucchini Alfredo](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/recipes/a51442/chicken-zucchini-alfredo-recipe/) - If you have a mandolin, you can cut up zucchini to make pasta that's amazing.
* [Chicken Parmesan](https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/b7uso3/keto_chicken_parm/)
* [Butter Chicken](https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/aktsqw/the_best_keto_butter_chicken_over_cauliflower/)
* [Thai Peanut Chicken](https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/bnxnwj/spicy_thai_peanut_chicken/)
* [Pesto Chicken Avocado Salad](https://www.savorylotus.com/pesto-chicken-avocado-salad/)
* [Tuscan Chicken](https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/a4g6iw/creamy_tuscan_chicken_with_roasted_asparagus/)
* [Bacon, Avocado, Chicken Sandwich](https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/9ag2pw/bacon_avocado_and_chicken_sandwich/?st=JLB65CHQ&sh=24d06f0a) - Using the [fathead buns](https://www.reddit.com/r/GifRecipes/comments/9scjzq/lowcarb_keto_bagels_fathead_dough/e8nph5x/ ) recipe in the link below.

### Beef
* [Cheese Taco Shells](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/recipes/a52731/cheese-taco-shells-recipe/) - These and some ground beef with some low carb seasoning make a great taco meal.
* [Guac Bacon Burger](https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/9h93rf/guacamole_bacon_burger_on_cheesebuns/) - Also using the [fathead buns](https://www.reddit.com/r/GifRecipes/comments/9scjzq/lowcarb_keto_bagels_fathead_dough/e8nph5x/) recipe below.

### Crab
* [Crab Stuffed Mushroom](https://www.savorytooth.com/crab-stuffed-mushrooms/)
* [Crab Cakes](https://lowcarbyum.com/keto-crab-cakes/) - This is our most made meal. We use Alaskan faux crab (krab), and I just brown it in a pan, no making cakes. But the combination of ingredients here is great.

### Fish
* [Coconut Curry Thai Fish](https://www.dietdoctor.com/recipes/keto-thai-fish-curry-coconut) - This one is great when your fridge looks empty, because we always have frozen tilapia. Goes great with some broccoli.

### Shrimp
* [Sheet Pan Cajun Shrimp](https://keto-daily.com/keto-sheet-pan-shrimp-recipe/?fbclid=IwAR0zDUl6Q5PvkRquoFq99Xwzjjanm02ZhBHrzbuPznWzzozyDNafztqTc1M) - I usually add some Andouille sausage to this.
* [Crispy Shrimp](https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/c1mr1y/crispy_shrimp_0g_carbs/)

### Other
* [Fathead Buns](https://www.reddit.com/r/GifRecipes/comments/9scjzq/lowcarb_keto_bagels_fathead_dough/e8nph5x/) - I make these all the time, and they taste great for a week! I usually make these into balls to make buns, instead of bagels.
* [Zucchini Fried Ravioli](https://culinarylion.com/recipes/zucchini-fried-ravioli/) - This is our absolute favorite recipe, period. But it's really annoying and time consuming to make, so I don't make it often.
* [In N Out Style Salad](https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/409b7q/homemade_innoutinspired_animal_style_salad/)
* [Buffalo Cauliflower Bites](https://www.wholesomeyum.com/recipes/baked-healthy-buffalo-cauliflower-bites-wings-recipe/)
* [Lasagna Stuffed Mushrooms](https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/99p88p/lasagna_stuffed_portobello_mushroom_with_bacon/)
