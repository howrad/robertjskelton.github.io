I yellow tinted my fog lights on the GX, it was pretty simple. Here's how to do it.

![Fog Lights](/images/fog/1.jpg)

Take your fog lights off the car. This is a 10mm bolt behind each light, which can be reached easily just by laying under the front bumper.

Take the fogs to your work station. Clean the housing really well. Get out your tint, I used [this yellow tint from Amazon](https://amzn.to/32QXscE).

Spray some water from a spray bottle on the lights, then apply the film, sticky side touching the lights. Spray some more water on the outside of the film, then squeegee the water out, using the included tool or a credit card, or similar.

Finish getting all the water out, then use a hair dryer on VERY HOT to get the edges. Use scissors or a utility knife to cut the ends to look seamless.

Reinstall back on the GX!
