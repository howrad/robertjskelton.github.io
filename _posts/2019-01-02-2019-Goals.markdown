Here are my goals for 2019.

### Financial
* Max out my Roth IRA ($6k)
* Max out my fianc√©s Roth IRA ($6k)
* Max out my 401k ($19k)
* Keep 5k in an Ally Emergency Fund
* Have 35k saved in taxable investment accounts for a down payment on our next house
* Reach a Net Worth of 330k
* Have a total of 110k invested in retirement accounts
* Have a total of 150k invested in everything
* Roll over HSA to Fidelity. I'll be married in 2019, and we're getting better health insurance, so I lose access to my HSA. The existing HSA will charge high fees if I'm not contributing to it, so I'm moving it to a no-fee Fidelity HSA.
* Don't buy a car

### House
* Redo Closet in Owen's Room
* Finish second bathroom renovation (shower, floors)
* Finish master closet
* Paint outside of house
* Grow grass in side yard
* Redo gutters by the side yard
* Start composting
* Redo lavender garden, maybe move a fruit tree from the back to here
* Add a front garden
* Rip out grass around fruit trees and add soil/composting
* Pressure wash pool area
* Redo the kitchen. This is an expensive one that I hope to get to this year, it was also on my list for last year.

### Education
* Pass 2 Georgia Tech classes
* Get Elizabeth and my college diplomas framed
* Obtain a AWS Professional level Certification

### Other
* Get married
* Weight down to 185
* Beat Final Fantasy 9
